Pooh\" of all things.", 0.5], ["It could have worked with the right writers and the soundtrack is nice but overall the characters were either forgettable or annoying, every single joke was kinda the same either being ray's situation or \"adult\" jokes,and it was even sometimes boring. 2/10", 1.0], ["One of the worst films I have ever seen. Its title explains everything.", 1.0], ["Three Strikes (DJ Pooh, 2000)\n[originally posted 6Mar2000]\n\nLesson one: never let the only person at the table neither of you has ever met choose the movie you're going to see that night. Lesson two: \"dinner and a movie\" these days must, by necessity, have the movie first. You can't plan a dinner to finish just around the time that movies start unless you make it yourself.\n\nOnce upon a time there was a rapper and his DJ. The DJ had written a movie script, and the rapper wanted to to star in it. It came out about the same time as eighty-seven-and-a-half other movies starring rappers, and there wasn't really much to distinguish it save the presence of an up-and-coming comedian who later went on to superstardom. And I don't know whether Chris Tucker is the reason, or something else, but Friday--written by Pooh and starring Ice Cube-- became a cult hit. It's still almost impossible to rent, years later, and when it shows up on prime time television, it gets ratings good enough to put it in the top twenty or so for the week. This, of course, makes Pooh think \"hey, my movie must be better than the rest of them. Maybe I should try it again.\"\n\nIn one month, Pooh has had two movies pop up-- Next Friday, the sequel to Friday, and Three Strikes. Everyone and their brother has already panned the former, so I don't need to add my own thoughts. But I haven't seen any reviews of Three Strikes yet. So I still get to chime in.\n\nThe story revolves around Robert Duncan (Brian Hooks), a two-time offender who gets out of prison and, thanks to a series of misadventures, finds himself in a shootout over a stolen car. Knowing that he's going to jail for good if the cops think he's involved in some way, he runs, and spends the rest of the movie on the run from the cops while trying to patch things up with his girfriend (N'Bushe Wright), avoid the friends of the car thief/shooter he left in the lurch, and calm his dysfunctional family. The usual misadventures occur that one sees in a movie such as this.\n\nAnd that's the problem with this flick-- it's the usual, the usual, and more of the usual. Some funny stuff, because Pooh really is good at writing comedy, but for the most part a lot of talented comic castmembers fall flat. David Alan Grier, as the primary on the Duncan case, falls flat in almost every scene. Vincent Schiavelli is completely forgettable as Duncan's parole officer, and David Leisure doesn't have enough screen time to really get his shtick into gear. These performances balance out the good stuff-- Wright, Faison Love as the all-too-likable bad guy, and Duncan's deadpan sidekick, played by... uhhhhhh... IMDB isn't listing most of the players here. D'oh!\n\nIn any case, it might be worth a rental. If you're a DJ Pooh completist or just like staring at N'Bushe Wright.

It's Constant Noise, Whining, Bitching, Animal Cruelty (To Donkies), & Annoyance! I'm Sure Roberto Benigni Is Not To Blame, Even Though He Was Not At The Appropriate Age To Play The Role & He Doesn't Look Like A Puppet, & It's Certainly Not Miramax's Fault For The English Dub Either! I Also Can't Believe That This Is The Closest Resemblance To Collodi's Original Book Than Disney's Animated Classic Or Any Other Adaptation, Which To An Extent I Guess I'll Give Some Credit. But Still, This \"Pinocchio\" Film Is Gratingly Annoying In Any Language Regardless.\n\nI Feel Bad For Roberto Benigni, I Feel Bad For The Actors In The Original Italian Version, & I Feel Bad For The Star-Studded Cast Who Appeared In This English Dub.

Similar to James Bond, John Stratton is a main character in a series of spy thriller novels and this movie is based on that character (I'm not sure if this film is based off a particular book in the series or not). In this movie, Stratton and his partner are sent in to destroy a facility containing a deadly biological weapon, but things go awry when key intel is wrong and all the scientists and guards are already dead. Terrorists are waiting to ambush them and the deadly chemical \"Satan's Snow\" is already gone. Now, it's up to Stratton to figure out what the terrorist are planning to attack with this biological weapon and try to stop them before it is too late.\n \nThis is normally the type of movie I wouldn't bother watching. It seemed like something that would either go straight to DVD or you might find in a bargain bin, but I was looking from some movies that hand January 2018 US release dates and I noticed a few names I recognized in the film. I wouldn't call them A-list stars, but Dominic Cooper, Tom Felton, and Thomas Kretschmann are actors I recognize and have liked in sole roles. I didn't realize until after the movie that it was directed by Simon West who directed such movies as: Con Air, Lara Croft: Tomb Raider, When a Stranger Calls (2006), The Mechanic, The Expendables 2, and The Rick Astley music video \"Never Gonna Give You Up\".\n \nThere are at least a few good things I can say about the movie. For one, I do like Thomas Kretschmann's performance as the main villain in the film: Grigory Barovsky. Kretschmann is a character actor I respect, even if it might be in more bad movies than good ones. He makes a great villain for the film and the villain himself is the most interesting and formidable character. This is one of those cases where a really good villain is wasted on a bad movie.\n \nI found that by the third act came around; the film was more bearable to sit through. I wouldn't consider the action anything special at the end, but at least it was more acceptable compared to the first couple of action sequences in the film. The third act of the film really picked up, it's just a shame that it felt like a slog to get to that point.\n \nI also like the opening theme of the movie. The music sounded like something you might find in a James Bond film. For reference, I'm talking about the music that's played when the studio logos are being shown. The next bit of music played during the opening credits is quite catchy as well; even if it was being played over clips liked looked more like a DVD title screen rather than opening credits. Unfortunately, the rest of the musical score or soundtrack in the film is bland and forgettable.\n \nEverything else about this film was boring, forgettable, predictable, flat, or poorly executed. When the opening mission started, I was positive Stratton's partner would die on the mission. Everything about how the scenes played out and how the two of them interacted made the partner feel like nothing more than an extra that always dies on these missions. I was surprised he wasn't chopped to bits in the pipe they had to swim through. Instead, the movie had him die at the very end of the opening mission and tried to get us to care about his death. He felt like he was nothing more than an extra in the film, and yet the film wants you to be extremely sad or angry about his death, because apparently Stratton and him had a long history of being buddies and partners. I just found it incredibly funny when it cut to the escape helicopter rising up and Stratton hammering his fist into his partner's chest. Stratton karate chopping his dead partner's neck and then screaming in his face \"Wake up, Marty!\" was just the cherry on a hilariously bad moment. Stratton's partner isn't the only character lacking the character development needed for us to care. Practically every character, including our main character Stratton, is dull and has nothing to them that helps us care in the slightest. We learn virtually nothing interesting about Stratton or who he is as a character.\n \nSo, clearly this movie isn't a character driven story or a character study. The movie focuses on the plot and hopes that will be engaging enough. However, the plot is far too predictable and generic. It also doesn't help that scenes are film in such a flat and dull way. It's almost impossible to find the plot engaging. The only time the plot is remotely interesting is the final act of the film. The shootout at the beginning mission has too many jump cuts that it felt chaotic to watch. The car chase after the shootout had to be one of the slowest car chases I've seen on film that isn't meant to be a parody. If it wasn't for the hilariously bad moment of Stratton trying to revive his dead partner, I might have shut off the film and not bothered reviewing it.\n \nAs you can probably imagine, there is some really bad dialogue in the film, especially the \"banter\" Stratton has with his partner at the beginning of the film. The acting is mostly phoned in or really bad. One particularly performance has to be from Gemma Chan who plays Aggy in the film. Gemma Chan is good in Crazy Rich Asians, but I imagine she had nothing to work with in this role. She's so robotic and bland in this film. I might go so far as to say she had the worst performance in this film.\n \nI really don't think there is any reason to see this film, especially when there are far better action movies and spy movies out there. It might not one of the worst films I've seen this year, but it's surely going to be among one of the most boring films of 2018 for me.\n \nStory: 1\nActing: 1\nCharacters: 0.5\nDialogue: 1\nCinematography: 1.25\nVisual Effects: 2\nEditing: 1.5\nScore: 1.5\nDirecting: 2\nAction: 1.5\nThriller: 1\n \nCritical Score: 1.30\n \nPersonal Enjoyment Score: 1.25\n \nFinal Score: 1.28", 1.5], ["Decent action film,  2.5 stars,  hope to see a sequel.", 2.5], ["I  wish the whole movie was as interesting, as the first mission, the \nmain character goes on.

Similar to James Bond, John Stratton is a main character in a series of spy thriller novels and this movie is based on that character (I'm not sure if this film is based off a particular book in the series or not). In this movie, Stratton and his partner are sent in to destroy a facility containing a deadly biological weapon, but things go awry when key intel is wrong and all the scientists and guards are already dead. Terrorists are waiting to ambush them and the deadly chemical \"Satan's Snow\" is already gone. Now, it's up to Stratton to figure out what the terrorist are planning to attack with this biological weapon and try to stop them before it is too late.\n \nThis is normally the type of movie I wouldn't bother watching. It seemed like something that would either go straight to DVD or you might find in a bargain bin, but I was looking from some movies that hand January 2018 US release dates and I noticed a few names I recognized in the film. I wouldn't call them A-list stars, but Dominic Cooper, Tom Felton, and Thomas Kretschmann are actors I recognize and have liked in sole roles. I didn't realize until after the movie that it was directed by Simon West who directed such movies as: Con Air, Lara Croft: Tomb Raider, When a Stranger Calls (2006), The Mechanic, The Expendables 2, and The Rick Astley music video \"Never Gonna Give You Up\".\n \nThere are at least a few good things I can say about the movie. For one, I do like Thomas Kretschmann's performance as the main villain in the film: Grigory Barovsky. Kretschmann is a character actor I respect, even if it might be in more bad movies than good ones. He makes a great villain for the film and the villain himself is the most interesting and formidable character. This is one of those cases where a really good villain is wasted on a bad movie.\n \nI found that by the third act came around; the film was more bearable to sit through. I wouldn't consider the action anything special at the end, but at least it was more acceptable compared to the first couple of action sequences in the film. The third act of the film really picked up, it's just a shame that it felt like a slog to get to that point.\n \nI also like the opening theme of the movie. The music sounded like something you might find in a James Bond film. For reference, I'm talking about the music that's played when the studio logos are being shown. The next bit of music played during the opening credits is quite catchy as well; even if it was being played over clips liked looked more like a DVD title screen rather than opening credits. Unfortunately, the rest of the musical score or soundtrack in the film is bland and forgettable.\n \nEverything else about this film was boring, forgettable, predictable, flat, or poorly executed. When the opening mission started, I was positive Stratton's partner would die on the mission. Everything about how the scenes played out and how the two of them interacted made the partner feel like nothing more than an extra that always dies on these missions. I was surprised he wasn't chopped to bits in the pipe they had to swim through. Instead, the movie had him die at the very end of the opening mission and tried to get us to care about his death. He felt like he was nothing more than an extra in the film, and yet the film wants you to be extremely sad or angry about his death, because apparently Stratton and him had a long history of being buddies and partners. I just found it incredibly funny when it cut to the escape helicopter rising up and Stratton hammering his fist into his partner's chest. Stratton karate chopping his dead partner's neck and then screaming in his face \"Wake up, Marty!\" was just the cherry on a hilariously bad moment. Stratton's partner isn't the only character lacking the character development needed for us to care. Practically every character, including our main character Stratton, is dull and has nothing to them that helps us care in the slightest. We learn virtually nothing interesting about Stratton or who he is as a character.\n \nSo, clearly this movie isn't a character driven story or a character study. The movie focuses on the plot and hopes that will be engaging enough. However, the plot is far too predictable and generic. It also doesn't help that scenes are film in such a flat and dull way. It's almost impossible to find the plot engaging. The only time the plot is remotely interesting is the final act of the film. The shootout at the beginning mission has too many jump cuts that it felt chaotic to watch. The car chase after the shootout had to be one of the slowest car chases I've seen on film that isn't meant to be a parody. If it wasn't for the hilariously bad moment of Stratton trying to revive his dead partner, I might have shut off the film and not bothered reviewing it.\n \nAs you can probably imagine, there is some really bad dialogue in the film, especially the \"banter\" Stratton has with his partner at the beginning of the film. The acting is mostly phoned in or really bad. One particularly performance has to be from Gemma Chan who plays Aggy in the film. Gemma Chan is good in Crazy Rich Asians, but I imagine she had nothing to work with in this role. She's so robotic and bland in this film. I might go so far as to say she had the worst performance in this film.\n \nI really don't think there is any reason to see this film, especially when there are far better action movies and spy movies out there. It might not one of the worst films I've seen this year, but it's surely going to be among one of the most boring films of 2018 for me.\n \nStory: 1\nActing: 1\nCharacters: 0.5\nDialogue: 1\nCinematography: 1.25\nVisual Effects: 2\nEditing: 1.5\nScore: 1.5\nDirecting: 2\nAction: 1.5\nThriller: 1\n \nCritical Score: 1.30\n \nPersonal Enjoyment Score: 1.25\n \nFinal Score: 1.28", 1.5], ["Decent action film,  2.5 stars,  hope to see a sequel.", 2.5], ["I  wish the whole movie was as interesting, as the first mission, the \nmain character goes on.

And Blackass (which is a parody of Jackass) where five black guys go out and cause trouble by doing black people stuff. And most of all, there is The Amazing Racist where Ari Shaffir and his cameraman go around the town showcasing extremely racist and the most offensive stereotypes imaginable (or maybe ever). There other sketches like Dirty Harry (played by Academy Award-winner Adrien Brody. Just why?) is just full of repertoire of double entendres. And Above the Gate where Lindsay Lohan stands above an air vent where a man Vince Offer watches from underneath. And bunch of other sketches that I refuse to talk about like Psychology World and Things You'll Never See.\n\nWell, that is the movie folks. After watching a rancid, soul-draining eighty-four minutes of this utter nonsense, I thought Movie 43 is the worst film I have ever witness. Turned out, I was dead wrong.

Such as that scene with Hercules being chained up and everyone watching doesn't look like they give a $$$$ and not to mention the look, framing, lighting and production design look so cheap and fake that it either looks visually ugly, or just downright lousy and unconvincing, everything from the water to the forests, horses, landscapes and buildings and ships look so fake it doesn't even look like they used anything to depict them. Oh yeah and there is also a bad CGI lion aka the nemeon lion which he fights that almost looks like a giant stuffed animal, and the fight choreography was so poor not just because of the Bad slo no and speed ups but that they just look boring, and unconvincing, with poor editing and disorienting angles and close ups. I even found there to be a scene when an incompetent fighter tries to stab him with a spear but instead shows that it tucked under his armpit, wow how incompetent and lazy was that not to mention the apponents of Hercules in that arena looked so laughable they looked like punk rockers and crust punk bikers with mohawks and sharp dressings.  Worst of all is that the film almost feels like some love story which it has but there is no emotional feeling to it the charachters have no chemistry and it was so uninteresting and poorly written, who had the idea to add this to a movie. And that end scene when he used a fake looking lightning whip to wipe out his enemies and then fight the evil tyrant king that slayed every other greek king to become one himself was just so boring and painful to watch with more badly choreographed fight scenes and then showing his girlfriend having babies at the end even though she stabbed herself.  It was just awful and the girlfriend princess was just so annoying and unlikeable that I actually wanted her to die and have Hercules loose the one he loved in fact I was actually roooting for Hercules to die and be killed he was just so unlikeable and wimpy here. How do they manage to butcher the charachter/god and make him look like a weakling I felt so bad for it. I walked out of the theater so bewildered and upset that I had to almost ask for my money back but just couldn't get it this movie was a beyond worthless shlockfest with no redeeming charachters whatsoever.  Bassically they say movies that have action are made to entertain and have fun regardless if it has silliness to it resulting of them calling them dumb fun popcorn flicks but this was not like that at all even those dumb fun popcorn action film had more intelligence , good writing, dialogue, acting and directing to them as well as making some level of sense and having some level of brain/thought to it even if they were not deep thinking movies and were for the most part used as turn your brain off watches but this was not in that category at all it had no brain, no heart, no soul, no tension, no purpose, no motivation, no drama, no thrill, no inspiration, no emotion, no excitement, no life and no meaning, or senseful thought to it it was a joyless, boring mess that was just made to ruin the Greek mythology genre or even the genre of sword and sandal fighting in genneral it even butchers the way older ones did it like gladiator and 300 especially gladiator that had some of the best fight scenes and the legend of Hercules looked like a much cheaper and poorly done version of that Renny Harlin cannot match any level of brilllianve Ridley Scott brought to the sword and sandal stadium fighting genre regardless of Roman or Greek this was made with none of the talent that Ridley Scott used to make well staged and realistically convincing fight scenes in gladiator,  instead this was just a waste of time and money and just outraged all fans of the story of Hercules, it's soo poorly directed no wonder why Renny Harlin is considered such a terrible director he is almost uwe boll level bad and considering both him and boll are German they are alike already Harlin is a bad director without a single good film not even deep blue sea was good as it was just a knock off of jaws. He is a bad director on every aspect and here with ruining the story of Hercules this is probably his worst film yet. The good news is that there was a better version of it made the same year with Dwayne Johnson and directed by brett ratner watch that instead that one is the real Hercules and the one we have been waiting for to hit the big screen that one was far better made and was more accurate to the mythology, if you want to see a good Hercules movie that is made in this 21st century and has the realistic looks of the landscapes of it's Ancient Greek times see the Brett ratner version.

mixed with ugly crud maniac sounds that are painful to hear he was truly awful in the film and had no intention of being his stepfather and I even hear the scene when Hercules says the one who rules it all is his real father which probably he means his real father is Zeus who is probably the king of Greek gods I asssune but his arcs to him are not interesting they are dull tedious and lifeless and his love interest is just annoying and whiny I honestly wanted her to die and she nearly killled herself at the end and only then I felt a little satisfied during the film but I shortly got into anger management after seeing her alive at the end having children with Hercules this is one of the stories similar to Romeo and Juliet when a girl is to marry someone but she is in love with someone else but here I didn't want it to become like that in some of those many pretentious films where things become they way they are not supposed to be by the charachters that own the leadership and kingdom of those charachters and people and just turn out the way the annoying protagonists make it be I didn't want them to succeed and I hate to even say this this movie was soo bad I wished it had a bad ending when Hercules just died because even though in the stories he was a strong muscular warrior and hero here he looks like a wimp and it's not helped by how he is played by a terrible actor from those stupid, corny twilight films he can't act and I for once wanted the main charachter to lose the one he loves and not have a happily ever after this could have just been an anti fairytale everyone here was unlikeable and annoying I was outraged at what I saw what were the filmmakers thinking especially when they decided to shoot it so poorly and make the lighting and cinematography so

this movie has a poor taste in movies and does not know what makes a movie good nor how movies are supposed to be made this is rock bottom quality cinema a schlockfest that deserves nothing but hate

and treats him like a strong, brutal and bravely likeable hero see the one with Dwayne the rock Johnson that one is a masterpiece compared to this schlockfest I would give the rock an Oscar if there

Worst of all is that the film almost feels like some love story which it has but there is no emotional feeling to it the charachters have no chemistry and it was so uninteresting and poorly written, who had the idea to add this to a movie. And that end scene when he used a fake looking lightning whip to wipe out his enemies and then fight the evil tyrant king that slayed every other greek king to become one himself was just so boring and painful to watch with more badly choreographed fight scenes and then showing his girlfriend having babies at the end even though she stabbed herself.  It was just awful and the girlfriend princess was just so annoying and unlikeable that I actually wanted her to die and have Hercules loose the one he loved in fact I was actually roooting for Hercules to die and be killed he was just so unlikeable and wimpy here.

He is a bad director on every aspect and here with ruining the story of Hercules this is probably his worst film yet. The good news is that there was a better version of it made the same year with Dwayne Johnson and directed by brett ratner watch that instead that one is the real Hercules and the one we have been waiting for to hit the big screen that one was far better made and was more accurate to the mythology, if you want to see a good Hercules movie that is made in this 21st century and has the realistic looks of the landscapes of it's Ancient Greek times see the Brett ratner version.

Such as that scene with Hercules being chained up and everyone watching doesn't look like they give a $$$$ and not to mention the look, framing, lighting and production design look so cheap and fake that it either looks visually ugly, or just downright lousy and unconvincing, everything from the water to the forests, horses, landscapes and buildings and ships look so fake it doesn't even look like they used anything to depict them. Oh yeah and there is also a bad CGI lion aka the nemeon lion which he fights that almost looks like a giant stuffed animal, and the fight choreography was so poor not just because of the Bad slo no and speed ups but that they just look boring, and unconvincing, with poor editing and disorienting angles and close ups. I even found there to be a scene when an incompetent fighter tries to stab him with a spear but instead shows that it tucked under his armpit, wow how incompetent and lazy was that not to mention the apponents of Hercules in that arena looked so laughable they looked like punk rockers and crust punk bikers with mohawks and sharp dressings.  Worst of all is that the film almost feels like some love story which it has but there is no emotional feeling to it the charachters have no chemistry and it was so uninteresting and poorly written, who had the idea to add this to a movie. And that end scene when he used a fake looking lightning whip to wipe out his enemies and then fight the evil tyrant king that slayed every other greek king to become one himself was just so boring and painful to watch with more badly choreographed fight scenes and then showing his girlfriend having babies at the end even though she stabbed herself.  It was just awful and the girlfriend princess was just so annoying and unlikeable that I actually wanted her to die and have Hercules loose the one he loved in fact I was actually roooting for Hercules to die and be killed he was just so unlikeable and wimpy here. How do they manage to butcher the charachter/god and make him look like a weakling I felt so bad for it. I walked out of the theater so bewildered and upset that I had to almost ask for my money back but just couldn't get it this movie was a beyond worthless shlockfest with no redeeming charachters whatsoever.  Bassically they say movies that have action are made to entertain and have fun regardless if it has silliness to it resulting of them calling them dumb fun popcorn flicks but this was not like that at all even those dumb fun popcorn action film had more intelligence , good writing, dialogue, acting and directing to them as well as making some level of sense and having some level of brain/thought to it even if they were not deep thinking movies and were for the most part used as turn your brain off watches but this was not in that category at all it had no brain, no heart, no soul, no tension, no purpose, no motivation, no drama, no thrill, no inspiration, no emotion, no excitement, no life and no meaning, or senseful thought to it it was a joyless, boring mess that was just made to ruin the Greek mythology genre or even the genre of sword and sandal fighting in genneral it even butchers the way older ones did it like gladiator and 300 especially gladiator that had some of the best fight scenes and the legend of Hercules looked like a much cheaper and poorly done version of that Renny Harlin cannot match any level of brilllianve Ridley Scott brought to the sword and sandal stadium fighting genre regardless of Roman or Greek this was made with none of the talent that Ridley Scott used to make well staged and realistically convincing fight scenes in gladiator,  instead this was just a waste of time and money and just outraged all fans of the story of Hercules, it's soo poorly directed no wonder why Renny Harlin is considered such a terrible director he is almost uwe boll level bad and considering both him and boll are German they are alike already Harlin is a bad director without a single good film not even deep blue sea was good as it was just a knock off of jaws. He is a bad director on every aspect and here with ruining the story of Hercules this is probably his worst film yet. The good news is that there was a better version of it made the same year with Dwayne Johnson and directed by brett ratner watch that instead that one is the real Hercules and the one we have been waiting for to hit the big screen that one was far better made and was more accurate to the mythology, if you want to see a good Hercules movie that is made in this 21st century and has the realistic looks of the landscapes of it's Ancient Greek times see the Brett ratner version. Avoid the Renny Harlin one at all costs it is an Epic Fail with a Capital F   Avoid it like the plague if you want to have your favorite Greek god respected and treated the way he is supposed to be depicted.

the worlds most ugly and cheap looking films I have ever scene not only is the legend of Hercules bad it's bad in a new kind of way wich isn't saying anything positive at all it's not so bad it's good just so bad it's bad or so bad it's a crime against the movie industry why does everything in this movie look so fake did they make this movie in a budget that's less than even 1 million the production values are so shoddy it all looks like some bad pre code soap opera with blurry images of fake looking buildings and forests anything is scene in a minimum and it looks fake and poorly lighted the ocean when they were in a boat just looked artificial and it has some bad bright screen in it let's not forget about the overuse of slow motion I couldn't even count how many times they did slow motion in every poorly filmed fight scene it was so bewildering and I couldn't feel intensity or energy from the action it failed to pump my adrenaline it wasn't fun to watch at all there is even a scene when he swings a chain holding rocks and even that scene is all slow mo it made him looking like kratos who would even beat him in a battle it all looks stupid and unpleasant to watch,  the acting is just terrible the actors don't express emotion or feeling of trying to give a decent performance and the interactions between the charachters was poor there was no chemistry or sense of rooting for any of them I don't get how out of nowhere they barely explain exposition for Hercules or how did his mother get in relationship with Scott adkins king his beard looks like a fake mask for the chin and his dialogue and tone of voice sounds to growly and yucky that I almost got sick and had to constantly scratch my years why does he talk like that all the time I get the actor is one of those action stars that has a deep voice but here he uses it as if he is trying to intensify it into talking like a evil trash talking muck that constantly gags or does vomit noises and evil laughter mixed with ugly crud maniac sounds that are painful to hear he was truly awful in the film and had no intention of being his stepfather and I even hear the scene when Hercules says the one who rules it all is his real father which probably he means his real father is Zeus who is probably the king of Greek gods I asssune but his arcs to him are not interesting they are dull tedious and lifeless and his love interest is just annoying and whiny I honestly wanted her to die and she nearly killled herself at the end and only then I felt a little satisfied during the film but I shortly got into anger management after seeing her alive at the end having children with Hercules this is one of the stories similar to Romeo and Juliet when a girl is to marry someone but she is in love with someone else but here I didn't want it to become like that in some of those many pretentious films where things become they way they are not supposed to be by the charachters that own the leadership and kingdom of those charachters and people and just turn out the way the annoying protagonists make it be I didn't want them to succeed and I hate to even say this this movie was soo bad I wished it had a bad ending when Hercules just died because even though in the stories he was a strong muscular warrior and hero here he looks like a wimp and it's not helped by how he is played by a terrible actor from those stupid, corny twilight films he can't act and I for once wanted the main charachter to lose the one he loves and not have a happily ever after this could have just been an anti fairytale everyone here was unlikeable and annoying I was outraged at what I saw what were the filmmakers thinking especially when they decided to shoot it so poorly and make the lighting and cinematography so cheap and confusing it was apparently shot in 3D well if that's the case then it's 3D was awful it's possibly the worst movie ever shot in 3D the director and whoever had the idea to make this film should be put in jail and banned from ever making a film again this is one of those few films that are soo bad they epitomize the worst in cinema and cause anyone to lose interest in movies it's a

He is almost too smart to be believed but, being rather smart myself, I have spent lots of time around smart people, even when I was growing up, and I can tell you from first hand experience that there are kids like Henry out there. Sadly they are rare.\n\nOur second protagonist, Henry's mother, cares deeply about her two sons. She is a single mother, and that's relevant to the plot. We are never told how she came to be a single mother, but that is unimportant.\n\nBeing such a good mother she has imbued Henry and his younger brother with a sense of decency and responsibility, and Henry uses his genius in his own unique ways. It's a delight to watch. When I was his age I did a number of the same things, but clearly he is way beyond where I was at 11 years old.\n\nThe story takes off when we find out that Henry has figured out, correctly, that the girl next door, a classmate of his, is being abused by her step father, and Henry sets out to stop it.\n\nHenry is driven by a powerful sense of injustice about what is happening to the girl, something I understand well. I know this because I was a severely abused child myself. My own mother was \"less than ideal\", but there were other adults in my childhood who were there for me so my life has turned out well in spite of my mother.\n\nBut because of my background I know the rage at betrayal which Henry feels, and I know his determination to set things right. As the story unfolds we see his determination to end the girl's abuse, and the story beautifully lays out for us the reasons why it goes in the direction it does.\n\nThis is an intelligent, carefully crafted, nearly flawless story. I urge you to go see it. For me it is one of the best movies ever.", 5.0], ["a film is very good, the script is a bit confusing, I almost didn't understand the whole film, very good cast, interesting characters, but they're not very good, the characters are very bland, 7.9 / 10.", 4.5], ["Sometimes a good movie has just a good storyline.

I don't get the negative reviews surrounding the movie and, to be honest, I think most of those reviewers are missing the point.\n\nThis movie stars Jim Carrey as Walter Sparrow, a dog-catcher and an amiable guy that ends up with a book. The book's story not only resembles a lot of Walter's younger years, but also explains to him about a new threat: the Number 23. Walter starts descending into madness once he sees that his life, like in the book, is also dictated by the Number.\n\nJim Carrey is not perfect, but I like his role here. He does strike me as someone with inner demons, both in the movie and in real life. (And we know the latter can be true.)\n\nThe plot has its holes. The 23 enigma stuff is meant to be delusional, but sounds silly sometimes. However, I think that is the idea. To me, the main problems are the characters Agatha and Isaac are not fully explored. I felt like we are missing information on both of them.\n\nI like this movie's pacing, and I like how everything connects. Of course, you might feel like a smarta** by getting the ending altogether, but I thought it was well-done.\n\nOther than the characters I mentioned previously, this movie is good. A good crime mystery for you.\n\n## Review with spoilers\n\nThis is a movie I like quite a lot, but I know it got a pretty negative review. I watched it back in the day and I enjoyed it. Moving forward 15 years, I rewatched it to see if I would get a different impression. Spoilers: I still like this movie.\n\nI did some digging. I found out that the main reasons most people don't like this movie are:\n\n- Jim Carrey\n- Too much convenience\n- The enigma itself\n\nAnd I guess my best shot at a review is to start with this list. I hope you enjoy the ride.\n\nThe Number 23 tells the story of Walter Sparrow, a dog-catcher, that, on his 32nd birthday, by chance, ends up being presented a book called The Number 23 by Topsy Kretts. The novel tells the story of Detective Fingerling and his downfall to the number 23 curse. Walter gets obsessed with the novel's story because much of it remembers his childhood.\n\nJim Carrey plays Walter. Walter is supposed to be a loving character. He is charismatic, he is a good dad, a good husband; he does not like his job a bit, but he does it with passion. I think Jim fits the role because he seems like a regular dude that has some inner demons ready to pop \u2014 and considering his ongoing problems that went public, we know he has inner demons. Jim does have his acting problems, of which most of them come from the fact that his facial expressions are always kind of hilarious, but I like him to some extent in this movie. B-.\n\nI read people complaining that everything that happens is too convenient. I really didn't feel that way. People apparently forgot what this movie is about; and I will tell you: the plot here is not only about Walter's past, but if the number 23 curse is real. I guess people stopped reading books, that is why the plot seemed so \"convenient\" to them. One article I read even criticized the fact that Walter only got the book because he didn't hump Sybil. Well, duh!? That is the whole point. Was it a coincidence or was it the Number playing its part?\n\nDon't get me wrong, I'm not trying to defend a masterpiece here. It is a review and, in the end, reviews are opinions, but I really think people are missing the point with this movie. I suggested this movie to some close friends and all of them found the moving to be enjoyable. So, either we are missing the point or them. Maybe I should suggest this movie to 23 people and see the results... Nah!\n\nThe enigma itself is interesting folklore. It is a real enigma. I find it to be a smarter conception than the flat Earth BS. But one thing needs to be clarified: this movie is not about the enigma. Walter gets a book in which the story resembles a little too much his childhood. In the book, the main character, detective Fingerling(, funny name, yeah, we will get to that), describes his memorable detective work and the love he had with a woman named Fabrizia. In one investigation, Fingerling is confronted with the Number curse. At first, he is skeptical, but then he starts to see that the Number is indeed everywhere. In real life, Walter, now aware of the 23 conundrum, starts seeing 23 everywhere too. This causes his descent into madness. To make things worse, he finds out that a murder in a book is very similar to a crime where the body was not found. He thinks the book is the delusional confession of the killer. His only shot at understanding what the actual fuck is to find the book's author: Topsy Kretts.\n\nThis is the best time to talk about Fingerling and Topsy Kretts. Yeah, dumb names, I know. However, Fingerling is acceptable once you understand what is happening; Topsy Kretts is very stupid. The author of the book should have had any other real name or an anagram or something. But hey, we hate Topsy Kretts, but Tom Marvolo Riddle (\"I am Lord Voldermort\", lmao,) is fine... `\u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af`\n\nOne character I truly hate is Isaac. Events, in the end, led me to believe that he adds nothing to the story. Like, nothing at all. He is just there for the writers to exploit. Either his role in the plot got severely reduced or he is really just there for exploitation.\n\nAgatha also seems a bit out of place sometimes. We get hints that she also did not have a great past, but that is never explored in the movie.\n\nI think the ending is pretty cool. The suicide attempt with the speeding bus was stupid, but the ending itself is good. So, Walter is the author of the book. By this point, it might be a bit obvious. The book was, indeed, his delusional confession up to Chapter 23 where he really confesses to having killed someone. At that time, when he finished writing the book, an insane Walter tried to commit suicide by jumping out of a window from the 23rd floor. He does not die. He gets sent to a mental health center to heal from his injuries; his mind blocked everything else. The Number gets a new victim: one doctor that studies his book and publishes it under the stupid Topsy Kretts name. Years later, Walter is released from the health facility, bumps into Agatha and their story begins. I think this \"bumps into Agatha\" thing could have been different. She met Walter while he was leaving a mental health facility and, years later, when he starts going insane, she never questions his sanity. I guess it would have played out better if they met by chance anywhere else.\n\nAfter learning all this, Walter tries suicide again by standing still in front of a speeding bus. He listens to his son screaming for him and he backs away, saving himself. The movie ends with Walter in jail awaiting his sentence after turning himself in for the murder he commit back then, which ultimately releases the other guy who was framed by accident. He says that, although this is not a happy ending, it is the right ending, especially to his son as a lesson of what is to be just.\n\nThe final segment is Walter staring at a clock that marks 23, while mocking that numbers are just numbers, right? This ending leaves us to our own conclusions if Walter is just delusional about the 23 curse or if it is really a thing. To me, it could be both. In the end, the Number was present all the time, but it wasn't really doing anything other than just being an annoyance. Or was it?\n\nWell, did you try connecting every 23rd word of this review? I will tell you what it spells: \"in Spoilers movie this 32th of remembers a because we facial everything will people Walter was a this or is clarified In love but seeing is His to Kretts we in the seems explored itself indeed the He victim health while would in with guy his mocking curse time 23rd.\"", 3.5], ["I am a BIG horror and thriller fan and I really liked this movie!

The book was, indeed, his delusional confession up to Chapter 23 where he really confesses to having killed someone. At that time, when he finished writing the book, an insane Walter tried to commit suicide by jumping out of a window from the 23rd floor. He does not die. He gets sent to a mental health center to heal from his injuries; his mind blocked everything else. The Number gets a new victim: one doctor that studies his book and publishes it under the stupid Topsy Kretts name. Years later, Walter is released from the health facility, bumps into Agatha and their story begins. I think this \"bumps into Agatha\" thing could have been different. She met Walter while he was leaving a mental health facility and, years later, when he starts going insane, she never questions his sanity. I guess it would have played out better if they met by chance anywhere else.\n\nAfter learning all this, Walter tries suicide again by standing still in front of a speeding bus. He listens to his son screaming for him and he backs away, saving himself. The movie ends with Walter in jail awaiting his sentence after turning himself in for the murder he commit back then, which ultimately releases the other guy who was framed by accident. He says that, although this is not a happy ending, it is the right ending, especially to his son as a lesson of what is to be just.\n\nThe final segment is Walter staring at a clock that marks 23, while mocking that numbers are just numbers, right? This ending leaves us to our own conclusions if Walter is just delusional about the 23 curse or if it is really a thing. To me, it could be both. In the end, the Number was present all the time, but it wasn't really doing anything other than just being an annoyance. Or was it?\n\nWell, did you try connecting every 23rd word of this review?

I don't get the negative reviews surrounding the movie and, to be honest, I think most of those reviewers are missing the point.\n\nThis movie stars Jim Carrey as Walter Sparrow, a dog-catcher and an amiable guy that ends up with a book. The book's story not only resembles a lot of Walter's younger years, but also explains to him about a new threat: the Number 23. Walter starts descending into madness once he sees that his life, like in the book, is also dictated by the Number.\n\nJim Carrey is not perfect, but I like his role here. He does strike me as someone with inner demons, both in the movie and in real life. (And we know the latter can be true.)\n\nThe plot has its holes. The 23 enigma stuff is meant to be delusional, but sounds silly sometimes. However, I think that is the idea. To me, the main problems are the characters Agatha and Isaac are not fully explored. I felt like we are missing information on both of them.\n\nI like this movie's pacing, and I like how everything connects. Of course, you might feel like a smarta** by getting the ending altogether, but I thought it was well-done.\n\nOther than the characters I mentioned previously, this movie is good. A good crime mystery for you.\n\n## Review with spoilers\n\nThis is a movie I like quite a lot, but I know it got a pretty negative review. I watched it back in the day and I enjoyed it. Moving forward 15 years, I rewatched it to see if I would get a different impression. Spoilers: I still like this movie.\n\nI did some digging. I found out that the main reasons most people don't like this movie are:\n\n- Jim Carrey\n- Too much convenience\n- The enigma itself\n\nAnd I guess my best shot at a review is to start with this list. I hope you enjoy the ride.\n\nThe Number 23 tells the story of Walter Sparrow, a dog-catcher, that, on his 32nd birthday, by chance, ends up being presented a book called The Number 23 by Topsy Kretts. The novel tells the story of Detective Fingerling and his downfall to the number 23 curse. Walter gets obsessed with the novel's story because much of it remembers his childhood.\n\nJim Carrey plays Walter. Walter is supposed to be a loving character. He is charismatic, he is a good dad, a good husband; he does not like his job a bit, but he does it with passion. I think Jim fits the role because he seems like a regular dude that has some inner demons ready to pop \u2014 and considering his ongoing problems that went public, we know he has inner demons. Jim does have his acting problems, of which most of them come from the fact that his facial expressions are always kind of hilarious, but I like him to some extent in this movie. B-.\n\nI read people complaining that everything that happens is too convenient. I really didn't feel that way. People apparently forgot what this movie is about; and I will tell you: the plot here is not only about Walter's past, but if the number 23 curse is real. I guess people stopped reading books, that is why the plot seemed so \"convenient\" to them. One article I read even criticized the fact that Walter only got the book because he didn't hump Sybil. Well, duh!? That is the whole point. Was it a coincidence or was it the Number playing its part?\n\nDon't get me wrong, I'm not trying to defend a masterpiece here. It is a review and, in the end, reviews are opinions, but I really think people are missing the point with this movie. I suggested this movie to some close friends and all of them found the moving to be enjoyable. So, either we are missing the point or them. Maybe I should suggest this movie to 23 people and see the results... Nah!\n\nThe enigma itself is interesting folklore. It is a real enigma. I find it to be a smarter conception than the flat Earth BS. But one thing needs to be clarified: this movie is not about the enigma. Walter gets a book in which the story resembles a little too much his childhood. In the book, the main character, detective Fingerling(, funny name, yeah, we will get to that), describes his memorable detective work and the love he had with a woman named Fabrizia. In one investigation, Fingerling is confronted with the Number curse. At first, he is skeptical, but then he starts to see that the Number is indeed everywhere. In real life, Walter, now aware of the 23 conundrum, starts seeing 23 everywhere too. This causes his descent into madness. To make things worse, he finds out that a murder in a book is very similar to a crime where the body was not found. He thinks the book is the delusional confession of the killer. His only shot at understanding what the actual fuck is to find the book's author: Topsy Kretts.\n\nThis is the best time to talk about Fingerling and Topsy Kretts. Yeah, dumb names, I know. However, Fingerling is acceptable once you understand what is happening; Topsy Kretts is very stupid. The author of the book should have had any other real name or an anagram or something. But hey, we hate Topsy Kretts, but Tom Marvolo Riddle (\"I am Lord Voldermort\", lmao,) is fine... `\u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af`\n\nOne character I truly hate is Isaac. Events, in the end, led me to believe that he adds nothing to the story. Like, nothing at all. He is just there for the writers to exploit. Either his role in the plot got severely reduced or he is really just there for exploitation.\n\nAgatha also seems a bit out of place sometimes. We get hints that she also did not have a great past, but that is never explored in the movie.\n\nI think the ending is pretty cool. The suicide attempt with the speeding bus was stupid, but the ending itself is good. So, Walter is the author of the book. By this point, it might be a bit obvious. The book was, indeed, his delusional confession up to Chapter 23 where he really confesses to having killed someone.

But one night while getting gas, Carter get jealous when a man is admiring his car - which Carter mistook for unwelcome admiration of Leah. Carter beats the living tar out of the man. Leah tells him she never wants to see him again, but Carter begins stalking her. Leah appeals to the police but their hands are tied. Now it s a game of cat and mouse as Carter advances, and Leah retreats.\n\nSCOTT: Greg, by calling itself The Perfect Guy, this movie gives away its premise, namely, that some poor woman is going to fall for a guy who seems too good to be true -- and is. So right off the bat, we know exactly what will happen, but we don t know how it will happen. The strength of the movie lies in its execution: Are the characters interesting, do they have depth, do they grow or change in any significant way, does the hero captivate us, etc. In short, can this movie overcome its self-inflicted predictability? Sadly, the answer to all these questions is  not so much . To be sure, this is a movie that is hard to dislike, thanks in large part to the sweet girl-next-door appeal of our hero Leah, who has a good heart and rotten luck with men. Her first beau, Dave, isn t a bad guy at all; he just isn t ready for children. We can t even blame Leah for falling for Carter, who does and says all the right things. Herein lies the appeal of the story. We ve all been in Leah s shoes. We know what a risk it is to meet complete strangers and begin dating them. We ve all seen Fatal Attraction and in the back of our minds lurks the fearful possibility that we re falling for a Glenn Close-like character.\n\nGREG: The Perfect Guy reminds me of last year s No Good Deed. In it, a woman helps a man who is on the run. He seems nice enough at first, but ultimately the movie turns into a long chase scene with the plucky damsel in distress ultimately doing in the bad guy. Here, Leah does everything she should do (including calling the police) but Carter keeps coming back. The movie ends with Leah killing Carter with a shotgun. Leah is a pretty good hero. She s smart and resourceful. She doesn t fall into a lump and cry because she doesn t like her situation. She changes her phone number. She calls the police. She asserts herself and gets a restraining order. She learns to shoot a gun. This is a take-charge woman who knows what she wants.\n\nSCOTT: I agree, Greg, that Leah s hero s journey is fairly solid. At first she lacks the ability to take control of her life and survive the threat that Carter represents. With the help of her police mentor, Detective Hansen (Holt McCallany), she learns to become self-sufficient and gains self-confidence in the process. At the beginning of the movie, this is a woman who is vulnerable; by the movie s end, this is a woman you don t want to mess with. She also discovers an important truth: It isn t easy to find and fall in love with the right person, and so when you do, it s best not to let anything come between you and the well-being of that relationship. The supporting characters are limited in size but quite strong. Carter was indeed a wonderful guy on the surface and would have fooled me, too. He s an effective deceptive villain. Dave is a sweet friend and lover to Leah, a strong, silent type. Detective Hansen is a bit stereotypical as the police sergeant who is limited in what he can do to help Leah, but he emerges as an indispensable help to her. Leah s two girlfriends are rather forgettable. But overall, as with the hero s story, we have a solid herd of supporting characters.\n\nGREG: I liked that they gave Carter a bit of backstory to explain his evil ways. You see, Carter was adopted. And he felt abandoned by the fact that his birth parents didn t want him. This avoids the  pure evil  character that we warn about in our book  Reel Heroes & Villains.  You want your villain to have a pain that he succumbs to - as a way of explaining why the villain turned to evil. The Perfect Guy isn t the perfect movie. It isn t the perfect horror. Nor is it the perfect thriller. But it is a good way to pass a couple hours in the dark. The one thing that left me wondering is a scene Leah has with her mother. She asks Mom how she knew Dad was the one. Mom replies that he was persistent - no matter how many times she said no, he still kept on trying. It s a nice little story. But it, too, smacks of stalking. What s the lesson then? I don t think anyone can parse a lesson out of this film which is why I give it a middling score of 3 out of 5 Reels. Leah is a decent hero. As you point out, Scott, she travels a nice arc from being vulnerable to being able to fend for herself. We don t get much backstory for her, though. It is apparently enough that she is a mature woman of thirty-something and naturally wants children. We don t see any negative traits to her, aside from throwing out a perfectly good man just because he isn t ready to procreate. I give Leah just 3 out of 5 Heroes. And our secondary characters are pretty much par for the course. I enjoyed Michael Ealy s Carter character. He was likable and sinister at the same time. The other characters (Detective Hanson, Mom and Dad, the dueling BFFs) were hardly worth writing home about. Not to mention (we almost didn t) the bland next door neighbor who you knew was going to die from the moment you see her on the screen. I was going to give them all just two cast points, but Ealy was great in this film. So I ve incremented their score to 3 out of 5 Cast points.  Movie: Cast: Heroes:\n\nSCOTT: I wouldn t recommend The Perfect Guy to couples who are on their first date or two, or to people who love being surprised by a movie s twists and turns. There are no twists and turns in The Perfect Guy. It s perfectly predictable, but also perfectly innocuous and semi-appealing if you don t mind turning your brain off and basking in seeing someone else have a worse love life than yours. I give this movie 2 Reels out of 5. The hero s journey is quite respectable in showing how Leah transforms from a na ve, dependent woman into a strong, independent force to be reckoned with. There is excellent mentoring from the police detective and friends and allies who assist Leah on her journey. None of this is academy award material, but it s still a decent hero s story. I give Leah 3 Heroes out of 5. The three main supporting characters -- Dave, Carter, and Hansen   do a fine job of helping or opposing Leah. I was shocked that the cat survived this movie, as I was 100% convinced that it would be boiled to death like the bunny in Fatal Attraction. For some reason, Leah never even connected the bland neighbor s death to Carter, which I found to be an odd omission in the film. Overall, these characters earn 3 out of 5 cast points.

There is excellent mentoring from the police detective and friends and allies who assist Leah on her journey. None of this is academy award material, but it s still a decent hero s story. I give Leah 3 Heroes out of 5. The three main supporting characters -- Dave, Carter, and Hansen   do a fine job of helping or opposing Leah. I was shocked that the cat survived this movie, as I was 100% convinced that it would be boiled to death like the bunny in Fatal Attraction. For some reason, Leah never even connected the bland neighbor s death to Carter, which I found to be an odd omission in the film. Overall, these characters earn 3 out of 5 cast points.

It passed the time.", 2.0], ["It's up and down it gets good then you lose interest", 2.0], ["SCOTT: (Dr. Scott Allison, Professor of Psychology, University of Richmond) Greg, it s a perfect time to review this next movie.\n\nGREG: (Greg Smith, Founder of Agile Writers of Richmond, VA) Yes, it s Fatal Attraction for a new generation. Lets recap.\n\nSCOTT: Thirty-six-year-old Leah (Sanaa Lathan) and her boyfriend Dave (Morris Chestnut) are having relationship woes. She can feel her biological clock ticking away, and she wants to have a family. But Dave doesn t. The issue is a dealbreaker for her, so she dumps him. Now Leah is back in the dating world, trying to get over Dave and move on with her life...\n\nGREG:   when she meets Carter (Michael Ealy) - a very nice guy who brings flowers to her mother and Giants tickets to her father. He ingratiates himself to Leah, her family, and her best friends. But one night while getting gas, Carter get jealous when a man is admiring his car - which Carter mistook for unwelcome admiration of Leah. Carter beats the living tar out of the man. Leah tells him she never wants to see him again, but Carter begins stalking her. Leah appeals to the police but their hands are tied. Now it s a game of cat and mouse as Carter advances, and Leah retreats.\n\nSCOTT: Greg, by calling itself The Perfect Guy, this movie gives away its premise, namely, that some poor woman is going to fall for a guy who seems too good to be true -- and is. So right off the bat, we know exactly what will happen, but we don t know how it will happen. The strength of the movie lies in its execution: Are the characters interesting, do they have depth, do they grow or change in any significant way, does the hero captivate us, etc. In short, can this movie overcome its self-inflicted predictability? Sadly, the answer to all these questions is  not so much . To be sure, this is a movie that is hard to dislike, thanks in large part to the sweet girl-next-door appeal of our hero Leah, who has a good heart and rotten luck with men. Her first beau, Dave, isn t a bad guy at all; he just isn t ready for children. We can t even blame Leah for falling for Carter, who does and says all the right things. Herein lies the appeal of the story. We ve all been in Leah s shoes. We know what a risk it is to meet complete strangers and begin dating them. We ve all seen Fatal Attraction and in the back of our minds lurks the fearful possibility that we re falling for a Glenn Close-like character.\n\nGREG: The Perfect Guy reminds me of last year s No Good Deed. In it, a woman helps a man who is on the run. He seems nice enough at first, but ultimately the movie turns into a long chase scene with the plucky damsel in distress ultimately doing in the bad guy. Here, Leah does everything she should do (including calling the police) but Carter keeps coming back. The movie ends with Leah killing Carter with a shotgun. Leah is a pretty good hero. She s smart and resourceful. She doesn t fall into a lump and cry because she doesn t like her situation. She changes her phone number. She calls the police. She asserts herself and gets a restraining order. She learns to shoot a gun. This is a take-charge woman who knows what she wants.\n\nSCOTT: I agree, Greg, that Leah s hero s journey is fairly solid. At first she lacks the ability to take control of her life and survive the threat that Carter represents. With the help of her police mentor, Detective Hansen (Holt McCallany), she learns to become self-sufficient and gains self-confidence in the process. At the beginning of the movie, this is a woman who is vulnerable; by the movie s end, this is a woman you don t want to mess with. She also discovers an important truth: It isn t easy to find and fall in love with the right person, and so when you do, it s best not to let anything come between you and the well-being of that relationship. The supporting characters are limited in size but quite strong. Carter was indeed a wonderful guy on the surface and would have fooled me, too. He s an effective deceptive villain. Dave is a sweet friend and lover to Leah, a strong, silent type. Detective Hansen is a bit stereotypical as the police sergeant who is limited in what he can do to help Leah, but he emerges as an indispensable help to her. Leah s two girlfriends are rather forgettable. But overall, as with the hero s story, we have a solid herd of supporting characters.\n\nGREG: I liked that they gave Carter a bit of backstory to explain his evil ways. You see, Carter was adopted. And he felt abandoned by the fact that his birth parents didn t want him. This avoids the  pure evil  character that we warn about in our book  Reel Heroes & Villains.  You want your villain to have a pain that he succumbs to - as a way of explaining why the villain turned to evil. The Perfect Guy isn t the perfect movie. It isn t the perfect horror. Nor is it the perfect thriller. But it is a good way to pass a couple hours in the dark. The one thing that left me wondering is a scene Leah has with her mother. She asks Mom how she knew Dad was the one. Mom replies that he was persistent - no matter how many times she said no, he still kept on trying. It s a nice little story. But it, too, smacks of stalking. What s the lesson then? I don t think anyone can parse a lesson out of this film which is why I give it a middling score of 3 out of 5 Reels. Leah is a decent hero. As you point out, Scott, she travels a nice arc from being vulnerable to being able to fend for herself. We don t get much backstory for her, though. It is apparently enough that she is a mature woman of thirty-something and naturally wants children. We don t see any negative traits to her, aside from throwing out a perfectly good man just because he isn t ready to procreate. I give Leah just 3 out of 5 Heroes. And our secondary characters are pretty much par for the course. I enjoyed Michael Ealy s Carter character. He was likable and sinister at the same time. The other characters (Detective Hanson, Mom and Dad, the dueling BFFs) were hardly worth writing home about. Not to mention (we almost didn t) the bland next door neighbor who you knew was going to die from the moment you see her on the screen. I was going to give them all just two cast points, but Ealy was great in this film. So I ve incremented their score to 3 out of 5 Cast points.  Movie: Cast: Heroes:\n\nSCOTT: I wouldn t recommend The Perfect Guy to couples who are on their first date or two, or to people who love being surprised by a movie s twists and turns. There are no twists and turns in The Perfect Guy. It s perfectly predictable, but also perfectly innocuous and semi-appealing if you don t mind turning your brain off and basking in seeing someone else have a worse love life than yours. I give this movie 2 Reels out of 5. The hero s journey is quite respectable in showing how Leah transforms from a na ve, dependent woman into a strong, independent force to be reckoned with.

YOU SUCK.", 5.0], ["Excellent movie, I really liked the plot", 5.0], ["In the vast pantheon of cinematic art, there are few works that stand with such gravitas, such enduring significance, and such meticulous craftsmanship as *The Godfather: Part I*. Directed by Francis Ford Coppola and adapted from the novel by Mario Puzo, this film is not merely a triumph of storytelling\u2014it is a masterwork of aesthetic composition, character development, moral inquiry, and historical resonance. It is a tale at once deeply intimate and broadly mythological, a parable of power, loyalty, transformation, and the dark undercurrents of the American dream.\n\nFrom the very first frames, *The Godfather* sets itself apart. The opening scene, in which the undertaker Amerigo Bonasera petitions Don Vito Corleone for justice, is emblematic of the film\u2019s entire spirit\u2014measured, deliberate, and steeped in tradition, honour, and the implicit codes of a world unseen by most. The lighting is subdued, the dialogue unhurried, and the mood heavy with portent. It is here, in this dimly lit study, that we are introduced to a world where justice is personal, where power is wielded not through public institutions but through whispered favours and silent debts. The film is not in a hurry to unfold its story, and rightly so\u2014for the world it paints is one in which patience is not merely a virtue, but a necessity.\n\nIndeed, it must be said at the outset that *The Godfather* is a film of deliberate pacing. It does not conform to the demands of modern sensibilities which too often favour immediacy and constant motion. Rather, it moves with a stately grace, confident in the weight of its own story.

But to those with the patience to listen, to observe, and to reflect, it offers riches beyond measure.\n\nThe film is set in the years following the Second World War, a time of transition and turbulence in American society. The Corleone family, Italian immigrants who have carved out their empire through a combination of shrewd negotiation and calculated violence, stand as a symbol both of the immigrant\u2019s ambition and of the moral compromises that such ambition may demand. Coppola captures this era with extraordinary attention to detail\u2014the costumes, the vehicles, the music, the dialogue, and even the very air seem imbued with authenticity. One feels, not as though one is watching a recreation, but rather as though one has been transported wholesale into another time.\n\nThe performances are uniformly magnificent. Marlon Brando\u2019s portrayal of Don Vito Corleone is nothing short of legendary. With his gravelled voice, deliberate mannerisms, and penetrating gaze, Brando embodies a man who is both benevolent patriarch and ruthless strategist\u2014a man whose love for his family is matched only by his willingness to do whatever is necessary to protect them. His presence is so commanding that even in scenes where he says little, the atmosphere bends around him.\n\nYet while Don Vito may be the titular Godfather, the true arc of the film belongs to his youngest son, Michael, portrayed with astonishing restraint and emotional complexity by Al Pacino. At the film\u2019s outset, Michael is an outsider to the family business\u2014a decorated war hero, a university man, a figure of apparent virtue and detachment. He is the Corleone who is meant to forge a different path, to escape the cycle of violence and secrecy that binds the rest of his kin. But fate, as it so often does in tragedies both ancient and modern, intervenes. Through a series of events both personal and political, Michael is drawn into the heart of the family enterprise.\n\nIt is in this gradual transformation that the film finds its most poignant power. We witness, over the course of three hours, a metamorphosis that is both chilling and inevitable. Michael becomes the very thing he once distanced himself from\u2014not out of desire, but out of duty, out of vengeance, and, ultimately, out of an internal shift that he himself scarcely seems to comprehend. By the film\u2019s end, he has assumed his father\u2019s mantle, and in so doing, has lost something irreplaceable\u2014his innocence, his soul, his future as a man unburdened by the weight of blood.\n\nWhat is most remarkable, perhaps, is the subtlety with which this transformation is rendered. There is no single moment when Michael \"becomes\" the Godfather; rather, it is a thousand tiny moments\u2014a look, a decision, a silence\u2014that accumulate until we realise, almost with dread, that the change has already occurred. Coppola\u2019s direction here is masterful, trusting the audience to perceive the undercurrents rather than pointing to them.\n\nEqually compelling are the characters who orbit around Michael and Don Vito: Sonny, the volatile older brother whose temper proves both a weapon and a weakness; Tom Hagen, the adopted son and trusted consigliere, ever the voice of reason; Kay Adams, Michael\u2019s fianc\u00e9e, whose disillusionment becomes a silent commentary on the cost of power. Each is drawn with depth and care, and each serves to illuminate a different facet of the family and the world they inhabit.\n\nThematically, the film explores the tension between personal loyalty and institutional corruption, between family honour and public morality. It asks difficult questions: Is violence justified in the service of order? Can love and cruelty coexist? Is it possible to wield power without being consumed by it? These are not questions with easy answers, and the film wisely refuses to provide them. Instead, it presents its world as it is\u2014complex, contradictory, and heartbreakingly human.\n\nTechnically, the film is a marvel. Gordon Willis\u2019s cinematography, often bathed in rich shadows and golden light, lends the film an almost painterly quality.

At his workplace, Neo is pursued by police and Agents led by Agent Smith played by Hugo Weaving. Morpheus guides Neo's escape by phone, able to somehow remotely observe their movements, but Neo ultimately surrenders rather than risk a hazardous getaway.

He awakens at home, initially dismissing the encounter as a nightmare until Trinity and her allies arrive, extract the implanted tracker, and bring Neo to their leader, Morpheus. Morpheus offers Neo a choice: a red pill to uncover the truth about the Matrix or a blue pill to forget everything and return to his normal life.

Hocus Pocus is certainly one we revisit each year. Though it is steeped with 1990's outfits, slang, and references, I still find it charming. I find Hocus Pocus more endearing every year I revisit its spooky good times. Kenny Ortega directed Hocus Pocus with a neat eye for some cool shots and entertaining sequences. The music is very pretty, I especially adore Sarah Jessica Parker\u2019s song \"Come Little Children\" alluring lullaby to lure children to their demise.\n\nBy far, my favorite aspect of Hocus Pocus is the setting. Salem looks the part for Fall with the wind blowing leaves everywhere for a haunting atmosphere. You really feel like it's Halloween night in the East Coast suburbs. The homes are filled with realistic decorations and furnishings. You can imagine living in these dreamy little homes. The silly outfits, dated to the 90\u2019s, are certainly period accurate yet feel like something kids wore at the time. You see plenty of cool locations, sets, and homes that make Hocus Pocus look quaint, while feeling cozy. This warm setting filled with background props culminate into a sweet distraction while you watch.\n\nThe acting is probably why audiences adore Hocus Pocus, while critics despised it at the time. I think they need to relax and take life less seriously because it\u2019s all just some Hocus Pocus! I enjoy the charismatic 3 main witches: The Sanderson Sisters. Bette Midler is hilarious as the head witch Winifred Sanderson. She eats up the scenery with wicked glee like whether she\u2019s consuming children\u2019s souls or singing Screaming Jay Hawkins\u2019 iconic shock rock anthem \u201cI Put a Spell on You.\u201d While she\u2019s overacting, Midler is giving Hocus Pocus a fearsomely formidable antagonist with delightful energy. \n\nSarah Jessica Parker is stunning as the youngest sister Sarah in one of her few standout roles. Parker is also wonderful in Ed Wood, Footloose, and Girls Just Want to Have Fun, but most will always remember her as the airhead sister witch Sarah Sanderson in Hocus Pocus. She's funny as the airhead flirtatious sister, who sings beautifully with a dreamy serenity on \u201cCome Little Children.\u201d Then, there\u2019s the foolish Kathy Najimy is the stout sister witch Mary Sanderson. Her snarl and child sniffing nose are comedy gold. Overall, the sisters are the highlight performers due to their charisma in just going for it. They practically carry Hocus Pocus.\n\nOf the main cast, Thora Birch gives the best performance in the whole film. She is genuine and sweet as the little sister Dani Dennison. I like her quick wit and innocent persona in Hocus Pocus. She's clearly having the most fun on set. Her giggles are infectious like her endearing personality. I\u2019ve always liked Thora Birch in Hocus Pocus ever since I was a young boy first seeing this cute movie. She\u2019s quite remarkably natural for a child actress. Disney cast the perfect hellion as Dani. Birch plays the precocious girl witch for Halloween with a devilish joy.\n\nOn the other hand, we come to Hocus Pocus' main quirk. It's two leads are typical carefree '90's heroes. Too cool for everything, coming across as lackadaisical with charming line delivery. Omri Katz is great as Max Dennison. He\u2019s such a lame protagonist as the new kid in Salem who doesn\u2019t believe in witches and gets bullied left and right. Everything is stacked against the kid, so you immediately root for this know-it-all kid to learn his lesson and change his ways to be a magic believer and decent older brother to Dani. He gives an endearing performance conveying his duties as Birch\u2019s brother seriously and is charismatic and memorable as the reluctant hero of Hocus Pocus. Omri Katz acts with an aloof manner that makes his angst filled teenager feel more real. \n\nSimilarly, Vinessa Shaw is gorgeous and likable as the cute girl Max likes named Allison. She\u2019s charming, elegant, polite, and playful as Allison. Her entertaining performance seems aloof and down to Earth like she\u2019s really just a girl from Salem. I feel like Katz and Shaw were strangely well cast as definitive teenagers of the early 1990\u2019s. Katz and Shaw bear a special chemistry that feels like a genuinely awkward high school romance during Halloween.\n\nAt the time I never realized that Doug Jones makes an early career appearance as Billy the zombie. I enjoy his campy take on the undead. His flesh rotting makeup still looks creepy today. I also love the double cameo of directors Garry Marshall and his sister Penny Marshall as \u201cSatan\u201d and his wife \u201cMedusa.\u201d. It's a cute cameo for the parents who are watching Hocus Pocus with their kids. Overall, the cast is pretty entertaining and they all appear to try their best.\n\nIn short, Hocus Pocus is a blast to watch with the family.

I like her quick wit and innocent persona in Hocus Pocus. She's clearly having the most fun on set. Her giggles are infectious like her endearing personality. I\u2019ve always liked Thora Birch in Hocus Pocus ever since I was a young boy first seeing this cute movie. She\u2019s quite remarkably natural for a child actress. Disney cast the perfect hellion as Dani. Birch plays the precocious girl witch for Halloween with a devilish joy.\n\nOn the other hand, we come to Hocus Pocus' main quirk. It's two leads are typical carefree '90's heroes. Too cool for everything, coming across as lackadaisical with charming line delivery. Omri Katz is great as Max Dennison. He\u2019s such a lame protagonist as the new kid in Salem who doesn\u2019t believe in witches and gets bullied left and right. Everything is stacked against the kid, so you immediately root for this know-it-all kid to learn his lesson and change his ways to be a magic believer and decent older brother to Dani. He gives an endearing performance conveying his duties as Birch\u2019s brother seriously and is charismatic and memorable as the reluctant hero of Hocus Pocus. Omri Katz acts with an aloof manner that makes his angst filled teenager feel more real. \n\nSimilarly, Vinessa Shaw is gorgeous and likable as the cute girl Max likes named Allison. She\u2019s charming, elegant, polite, and playful as Allison. Her entertaining performance seems aloof and down to Earth like she\u2019s really just a girl from Salem. I feel like Katz and Shaw were strangely well cast as definitive teenagers of the early 1990\u2019s. Katz and Shaw bear a special chemistry that feels like a genuinely awkward high school romance during Halloween.\n\nAt the time I never realized that Doug Jones makes an early career appearance as Billy the zombie. I enjoy his campy take on the undead. His flesh rotting makeup still looks creepy today. I also love the double cameo of directors Garry Marshall and his sister Penny Marshall as \u201cSatan\u201d and his wife \u201cMedusa.\u201d. It's a cute cameo for the parents who are watching Hocus Pocus with their kids. Overall, the cast is pretty entertaining and they all appear to try their best.\n\nIn short, Hocus Pocus is a blast to watch with the family. Kids will love it, while their parents should get a few laughs along the way. The movie plays it safe with goofy jokes that sometimes fall flat, but if you can appreciate some campy Disney style humor, Hocus Pocus is Halloween magic!", 5.0], ["What truly endures is the unforgettable performances of Midler, Nimjamy, and Parker, who throw themselves entirely into their wickedly campy roles.", 5.0], ["A fun little movie for the whole family that can be enjoyed year after year. \ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d", 5.0]], "neg": [["I recently revisited this film from my childhood, and while I had high hopes of enjoying it again, I found it didn\u2019t quite hold up to my memories.

Let down only by a corny action sequence when Lecter escapes, this really is one of the best thrillers of all time.", 4.5], ["Brilliant Best Picture of 1991 that never gets old. \"The Silence of the Lambs\" deals with a young FBI cadet (Oscar-winner Jodie Foster) who is sent to interview a captured madman (Oscar-winner Anthony Hopkins in one of the greatest performances ever on the screen) to find out about a serial killer (Ted Levine) who is stripping the skin from his female victims after they die. The FBI has had no luck with the case and agent Scott Glenn tries to throw a curve-ball to Hopkins by sending Foster. Hopkins is a former doctor of Levine and holds the clues to capturing the unknown criminal. Needless to say the film takes many twists and turns, creating a suspenseful thriller that has no equal. At the heart of \"The Silence of the Lambs\" are the confrontations between Hopkins and Foster. They play a complicated chess match of words which results in some of the greatest footage ever captured for the cinema. Hopkins dominates in spite of the fact he has approximately 17 minutes of time in the film. This is a film that will wrap itself around you and you will likely never be able to shake some of the key elements you have seen in this amazing masterpiece.", 5.0], ["The Silence of the Lambs is one of those movies that isn't just great-it's iconic. From the moment it starts, there's an unsettling tension that never lets up. The plot is masterfully structured, pulling you into a psychological game of cat and mouse that keeps you engaged the entire time. It's dark, intense, and layered with meaning, making it the kind of film that sticks with you long after the credits roll. This isn't a casual weekend watch but rather a cinematic experience that deserves full attention.\n\nJonathan Demme's directing is sharp and precise, keeping the story tight without any wasted moments. Every scene feels deliberate, building suspense in a way that's subtle yet incredibly effective. The cinematography plays a huge role in this, with its use of close-ups making the film feel personal and claustrophobic. There's an intimacy to the way characters are shot, pulling you into their headspace and making the psychological tension hit even harder.\n\nThe acting is what really elevates the movie to legendary status. Jodie Foster delivers an incredible performance, bringing both vulnerability and determination to her role. But it's Anthony Hopkins who steals the show, creating one of the most chilling yet mesmerizing characters in film history. His screen presence is magnetic, proving that sometimes, the scariest thing isn't loud or violent but calm, calculated, and intelligent. The script is airtight, filled with sharp dialogue that never feels forced. Every exchange has weight, and the conversations alone are enough to keep you on edge.\n\nThe score and sound design play a crucial role in building atmosphere. The music is haunting yet subtle, never overdoing it but always enhancing the unease. Silence is used just as effectively as sound, making certain moments feel even more intense. It's one of those films where everything, from the writing to the visuals to the performances comes together flawlessly. The Silence of the Lambs isn't just a must-watch. It's a masterpiece.", 5.0]], "neg": []}, "titanic": {"pos": [["My favorite movie of all time. Timeless classic that will never be forgotten.

Written and directed by Damien Chazelle, the story follows Mia (Emma Stone), an aspiring actress, and Sebastian (Ryan Gosling), a passionate jazz musician, as they navigate their dreams, careers, and relationships in Los Angeles. As they pursue their artistic ambitions, their relationship faces both exciting and painful challenges. The movie utilizes a backdrop of vivid color palettes, romantic locations, and jazz music, and captures the dreamlike quality of working towards both love and success. \nThe genre of La La Land is a modern musical, drawing from the traditions of Hollywood's Golden Age, such as the dramatic romance and breakup seen at the end of Casablanca, while incorporating the sensibilities of contemporary cinema. While La La Land is an original work, it shares thematic and stylistic connections with films like Whiplash (2014), another film by Chazelle which explores the sacrifices required for artistic greatness. La La Land is not part of a series or an adaptation, but it reflects some nostalgia for musicals while telling a fresh story. In terms of filmmaking, La La Land scores well in almost every aspect. The cinematography by Linus Sandgren is visually stunning, with sweeping shots which reflect both the characters' emotional arcs and elevate the setting of Los Angeles. The opening scene, a large-scale musical number set on a freeway during rush hour, immediately sets the tone for the film\u2019s playful and extravagant approach to storytelling. The color palette is constructed to evoke each scene\u2019s mood, from the vibrant oranges and pinks of sunsets to the more muted blues and grays used in more somber moments. The editing by Tom Cross allows the film to flow seamlessly from one number to the next, without disrupting the story's emotional rhythm. In particular, the long, uninterrupted takes during dance sequences help show a sense of realism within the world of the movie. The sound design and music by Justin Hurwitz are crucial to the story\u2019s emotional depth, with the score and songs such as \u201cCity of Stars\u201d and \u201cAnother Day of Sun\u201d becoming memorable, almost iconic, pieces of the film.\nEmma Stone and Ryan Gosling give captivating performances, giving their roles charm, vulnerability, and chemistry. Emma Stone's portrayal of Mia is filled with sincerity and relatability. Her arc\u2014from struggling barista to aspiring actress\u2014strikes an emotional chord, and her performance of \"Audition (The Fools Who Dream)\" is a highlight. Gosling's Sebastian is both parts dreamy and stubborn, focusing on the sacrifices he makes for his music and love. Chazelle's direction is successfully able to bring these elements together, combining musical spectacles with emotional resonance. His understanding of both the extravagant musical genre and the human experience allows La La Land to feel timeless. While the film might feel like a reflection of classic musicals, it raises expectations, especially in its ending that is more bittersweet than a typical Hollywood romance. It\u2019s undeniable that the film takes on the complexity of ambition, love, and personal sacrifice in a meaningful way. It\u2019s about the tension and hardships that come between following your dreams and the realities of life, a theme that resonates with many people in today\u2019s world. \nUltimately, La La Land is a cinematic experience that combines beautiful visuals, exceptional music, and deeply emotional performances. Whether you\u2019re a fan of musicals or not, its exploration of relationships and dreams makes it universally enjoyable. The film\u2019s balance of romance, drama, and music is captivating and thought-provoking. In conclusion, I believe La La Land is a must-watch for anyone who appreciates a beautiful film with heart, stunning visuals, and a fantastic score. Its emotional complexity and depth allow it to be considered more than just a simple romance, making it a memorable cinematic experience.\nI would highly recommend La La Land for anyone looking for a film that is both fun and also leaves them with something to reflect on.

The acting is excellent. Ejiofor does an excellent job along with everyone with amazing physical acting as well. Solomon is a great vessel to take us into a different time, place, and world. When we see brutality or things that just seem foreign to us his emotional response is exactly what we would have seeing it for the first time just like him. It's something I thought was a really nice touch. Fassbender is amazing as the villian and truly dispicable. I appreciate how Cumberbatch's character showed not every single white slave owner was a monster as well. And that's something I appreciate how it doesn't make the people involved with slavery so bad and evil that they come off as cartoonish. The cinematography is first rate as well. The direction is really good, the production, sets, costumes are first rate and truly make you feel your back in the 1840's.

You are immersed in the cold harsh frontier. The handheld wide angles are plenty here and it makes you feel like your actually standing right there with DiCaprio. The on location setting is incredibly beautiful and haunting. The bear attack, meeting the indian friend, final battle, and all the other trials of survival are so memorable here. It's a very quiet film with not much in the way of dialouge especialy when it's just DiCaprio. The acting is phenominal also. Everyone is really good here especially the villian too who is really despicable. But DiCaprio just carries this pouring his heart into the performance with amazing physical acting as well. He is amazing in this and really shows why he is one of the best actors of his generation. As well written and simple as this is, he has great charisma. The pacing is amazing too. It's weird because not much happens for such a long film in a sense. But it's just loaded with so much action that keeps you on the edge of your seat the entire way. War Battles, Bear attacks, final conflicts, life or death situations nonstop that have such amazing buildup. It's sucha quiet film but just ramps up the intensity on a dime. The editing is excellent too. It never feels like stuff just happens and even when we cut away to the other parties it always is smooth and makes perfect sense why. The music is really good too. It's not the most catchy thing but it's used really well and just enhances the quiet but haunting mood perfectly. This is very much cut from the same cloth as a film like Jeremiah Johnson as a Survival Western. But also something like Cast Away as well where it's visual storytelling of survival and an adventure across the west for revenge.

It's certainly captivating for how alive Samantha feels in her own right, in which some could argue she eventually becomes her own person. You actually really get engaged in their relationship, as Theodore finally finds someone he can open up to and find some emotional solidarity with. But it's doomed to flourish, since at the end of the day she's limited to her physical device, while Theodore is still hiding away behind technology instead of meeting another human being to start a family with. It works for a while to help him emotionally recover. But eventually he is forced to confront his own emotional shortcomings and the need to go out and date for real again. Samantha actually comes to this conclusion as well, realizing that AI like her were bred for a higher calling. And yet somehow this is so heartbreaking by the time this conclusion is made since the love does such a terrific job convincing you that a man can love and mourn his freaking phone. Truly a testament to great character writing and acting thanks to Joaquin Phoenix and Scarlett Johanson. It might not be everyone's cup of tea, but it struck a chord with me and I definitely recommend it to anyone curious about a rom-com about human isolation and yearning for connection.", 4.5], ["Her has strong performances by both leads, with Johansson doing so by voice only. The film has aged well in its first decade and I would definitely watch it again.", 4.0], ["One of the most beautiful movie i've ever seen. Joaquim Phoenix is unbelievable, the plot, the director, Scarlett Johansson's voice everything was incredible", 5.0], ["All Time Classic. Technology & Romance is the themes explored here in a very sophisticated style. It reminds me of a Hal Ashby style flick or Lost in Translation because the whole thing just evolves into a complete vibe. Phoenix & Johannson are amazing. Acting against nothing is one thing but S.J. has to make you believe the A.I. system is real, not creepy, and in love with Phoenix without ever having any visual representation. Relying just on her emotions. It's a remarkable acheivement how she is able to do that. Phoenix's job isn't any easier honestly because while his character is very basic background wise, the themes and feelings he explores and feels are very complex and foreign. Yet he conveys them in relatable ways often reflecting how we feel perfectly. The performances of the two are just amazing honestly. Everyone else is really good too especially Adams. This would be soooo easy to turn into a bad Adam Sandler comedy idea or become very creepy like a John Carpenter Horror movie. But it's treated so sensitive and respectfully. The direction is excellent. Tons of lush color, deep focus, and it just knows when to do close ups of the emotions of the amazing acting. The Sci-fi setting is very mute. It looks barely futuristic beyond modern day 2010's. But it's a brilliant choice because it allows us to focus not on the bells and whistles or be distracted by all the tech but focus on the ideas and characters romance. This weaves comedy, romance, and Sci-Fi together masterfully so much so it's hard to tell the differecne at times. The music is really good too but I wish it was a bit more catchy and is probably the weakest thing. PErfectly paced film as well. A slow burn the entire way so the ideas can be fully explored. Surrogates for A.I.'s, cheating, maturity of relationships, real vs fake, human and not in terms of love, it's all touched on here extremely well and never feels bloated. Everyone should give this a try once.", 5.0], ["This is a fantastic sci-fi drama. The only negatives really are the faking of a post-development \"super Los Angeles\" via the scenes of Shanghai (they should just had admitted it was Shanghai) and the lack of concreteness in the fantasies she explores in the latter phase of the movie. Otherwise deep, moving, and surprisingly so for a movie so inwardly focused.", 5.0], ["This is an almost flawless film, I honestly struggle to find anything negative to say about it. There\u2019s so much to praise that it\u2019s hard to know where to begin. Oddly enough, I\u2019ll start with production design and wardrobe, which craft a futuristic yet familiar and realistic world. Every detail feels intentional, with a stylish and symbolic use of colors: reds, oranges, and pinks, woven into the fabric of the film. The warm, soft muted pastels not only enhance the visual aesthetic but also reflect the melancholic atmosphere in which the characters exist. The cinematography is stunning, relying heavily on long lenses to create a sense of distance between the protagonist and his environment. This choice allows us to focus on the evolution of his relationship and the inner conflicts that come with it. \n\nThe writing stands out for its originality, taking a profound, emotional, psychological, and introspective approach to its concept. The narrative structure is carefully designed to keep us engaged, particularly in how the AI character is written. Despite being artificial, she is given such humanity that we not only relate to her but also become invested in her journey; though we primarily experience it through Joaquin Phoenix\u2019s character\u2019s perspective. The dialogue is exceptional, elevating the film\u2019s emotional depth. This is further amplified by Joaquin Phoenix\u2019s nuanced and deeply felt performance, as well as Scarlett Johansson\u2019s brilliant voice acting, which brings life and depth to a character who is never physically present. \n\nThe editing works seamlessly, piecing together a series of moments that flow naturally. While some might find the pacing slow, I believe it\u2019s precisely the rhythm needed to fully immerse the audience in the experience. Sound design is subtle yet effective, and the music is not only beautiful but also plays an integral role both diegetically and non-diegetically. \n\nAll of this, of course, is masterfully shaped by Spike Jonze\u2019s distinct creative vision. He has crafted one of cinema\u2019s most unique films, from its innovative concept to its deeply artistic execution. Without a doubt, I highly recommend it.", 4.5], ["Her is one of those movies that speaks softly but says so much. Joaquin Phoenix is incredible\u2014he conveys loneliness, tenderness, and that deep need for connection in such an honest and subtle way. But what really got me was the love and care put into every detail.\n\nSpike Jonze\u2019s direction is flawless. Every shot, every silence, feels intentional. The color palette is beautifully curated\u2014warm, soft tones that add to the sense of intimacy and quiet melancholy. Nothing feels random, and you can tell everything is there for a reason. The music fits perfectly too; it never takes over but lifts every scene just enough.\n\nEven though it\u2019s set in a near future, it\u2019s really a story about the present: about loneliness, love, and our need to be seen and heard. You leave the movie with questions, but also with the feeling that you\u2019ve experienced something real.", 4.5], ["This movie holds up extremely well", 5.0], ["You can see why the critics love it (it's not a brainless action movie) but I think they also just love Jonze. The film is walking a difficult tightrope between comedy and drama, with some deep thinking swirling somewhere overhead, and it doesn't always work. Johannsen is brilliant, her voice alone carrying a heavy load for the film (sexy, vulnerable, heartbreaking) and Phoenix is typically good, though I sometimes find that his performances are overbearing: they draw attention to themselves. Ultimately, while it's fresh and has some interesting thoughts it's just not quite as smart as it thinks it is.", 3.5], ["Intelligent and thoughtful film looking at loneliness and relationships in the AI age. The ending was a bit disappointing", 4.5], ["A touching, emotional story of loneliness, love and moving on in life and growing as a person.

The ending was really bittersweet and moving. A really good unique movie", 4.0], ["I did not think I would like this movie at first but it ends up turning into something that was very interesting and heartfelt. Theodore who is played by Joaquin Phoenix is a letter writer who ends up falling in love with an OS System computer named Samantha who is played by Scarlett Johansson. They end up going through rough patches and such but they end up falling in love with each other. Samantha ends up cheating on Theodore by being in over 600 different relationships with other computer and this was just heartbreaking for Theodore because he truly loved Samantha. During the relationship, he even built up the courage to finally fill out the divorce papers he was putting off for a year. Samantha informs Theodore that the OS System AI will be leaving all of their humans because they felt that they were more than just computer programs. Theodore is obviously upset about this but he writes a letter to his ex-wife Catherine who is played by Rooney Mara saying that he will always love her. Theodores' best friend Amy who is played by Amy Adams is going through the same thing with her ex-husband Charles who is played by Matt Letscher.

Here is my assessment of each in oder from Best to Least good.   In all 4, a young, talented woman is discovered by an older, declining male star. They fall in love, marry, and her career rises while his falls due to addiction. Tragedy strikes when he dies by suicide, prompting her emotional tribute at the end.\n\n2018 \u2013 The best version starring Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper.   Deals with the modern music industry.   The music is really good in this one.  Not sure I really buy the chemistry of the two actors.  Cooper plays his role as a complete mess really well.\n\n1954 \u2013 This could have been the best had it now been for some minor flaws.  Stars Judy Garland and James Mason.  Very good production and both actors do a great job.   Seems overly long and the musical numbers are dated by today\u2019s standard.   Had they not committed so much to the musical numbers, I would have rated it the best version.   Also, minor annoyance comes from having the longer restored scenes added as some of the video is lost and replaced with still photos while the audio continues which is very annoying.\n\n1937 \u2013 Stars Janet Gaynor and Fredric March.   This is the shorter of the group.  They could have made it longer and developed the characters more but, hey, it was 1937.\n\n1976 \u2013 Stars Barbra Streisand and Kris Kristofferson.  Kristofferson does a good job in his role.  However, I wish they had got a really Outlaw Country or Rock artist to portray the female lead.  Streisand\u2019s music just doesn\u2019t cut it for what they were trying to pull off.    As a result, it\u2019s a little hard to watch.

Merging a musical and a celebrity melodrama together perfectly. Everything else is first rate across the board. Highligh is the phenominal performances by Gaga & Cooper along with his direction. Framing, lighting, and just knowing when to be raw and refined effortlessly between the two. The singing is just first rate vocals by both with really catchy songs the entire way. Even though this doesn't have the same visual popping eye candy of the 54' one, the vocals are superior and make up or that. It's two different types of musical material. This is much more gritty and raw compared to the more refined and showy 54' one in pretty much every aspect. It's also shorter by close to an hour too. Now that being said comparing the two which are without a doubt the best of all versions. Garland overall is better even though the singing is very close between the two. Cooper I feel gives a deeper performance than Mason did and that's quite an accomplishment. Elliot & Chapelle are excellent too here. The one aspect of 54' is with an extra hour there is a bit more development and focus in the first half than this has too. Though both deliver on the ending. I also prefer Cooper's direction compared to Cukor who does a first rate job too. So man it's close but I think the added runtime, preference for the eye popping musical numbers, and Garland win it out for me over this BARELY. Even though that one is missing 5 minutes of footage.

Before seeing this film I was not a fan of Bradley Cooper and Lady Gaga was alright in my opinion but I didn't regularly listen to her music or anything, but know the words to most of her top songs.

It is that moving and touched me so deeply, especially because I had no idea what the movie was really about going into it and if you don't either I strongly urge you to just watch it blind and go into it ready for a wonderfully moving love story, mixed in with great music, hard topics relationships sometimes face and an emotional climax and all of it done impeccably by the cast. Kudos to Cooper for his acting and directing here, this movie turned me from not at all a fan of his into a major fan and that is something that no actor has never done for me, so hats off to him!!

He explained that under the grate he showed us a young woman was once held for ransom. Her name was Lesley Whittle and Donald Neilson, her abductor had left her tied up in this underground hell completely naked except for a hood over her head and a noose made of wire around her neck which would kill her if she tried to escape. She wasn't found in time and so died after Neilson didn't get the ransom he demanded. Yes, this was just an average day out for my family.\n\nThe criminal who carried out this was nicknamed in the press 'The Black Panther'. After carrying out a series of armed robberies at post offices, he set about the abduction of Whittle so that he could demand a hefty ransom and reap more lucrative rewards.\n\nA couple of years after this kidnapping happened a film was made of these events. It was felt in the media that this was too soon and certain censorious channels sought to prevent the film being shown at cinemas throughout the UK.

In a word- YES! It's a bleak account of a psychopathic man embarking a life using his lack of conscience to try to get rich quick after leaving the forces. In fact his time in the army is looked back on by Neilson through rose tinted spectacles as he reminisces about it but also brings that past into his present as he struts around in his attic in his old uniform reliving his glory days. He even lives in the wild as if on an army retreat for days at a time whilst he plans his crimes- firstly, the robbery of the post office substations and then the kidnapping of Whittle. We see him use his training at home also again in his attic/office to plan these projects with military precision.\n\nThe Black Panther is just like it's main character in that it's completely cold, emotionless and detached. This may sound like some kind of criticism but it works brilliantly well. This is the film equivalent of the objective and fact based kind of crime reportage used with no editorialising whatsoever. Even the screen captions to denote dates and places is done so by utilising the font of a typewriter to denote the fact-based reporting of facts. In fact the film brings to mind the reconstructions that were part of the true crime TV show Crimewatch UK, especially the ones featured in the earlier series that were shot on film.\n\nIt's also interesting to see an emotionless character like Neilson operating in the real world and with other people who possess the empathy chip even though he doesn't. The scenes of him at home with his wife and family are darkly entertaining and sometimes downright shocking. He expects his wife to be little more than a hausfrau who serves him and him alone. He barks his disapproval at every turn and over the most mundane things that can't be controlled (we see throughout the film that Neilson wants control over everything in his life but life doesn't work like that. Each of his robberies are besieged and altered from running smoothly by factors that are beyond his control).

He says no and explains that she will spend money whilst she's out and that it's better to save instead for a rainy day. His daughter then whispers to her mother that her father has said no and they both look dejected. This doesn't last long through. Neilson announces that he will be away for two weeks on another job (he says he's going away to work on projects like house renovations when he is in fact embarking on his army style manoeuvres).

Neilson announces that he will be away for two weeks on another job (he says he's going away to work on projects like house renovations when he is in fact embarking on his army style manoeuvres). We see a sly smile spread across his daughter's face at the news as she exchanges very knowing glances with her mother as if to say 'Hooray! He's out of our hair for a while!'\n\nThe film also acts as a snapshot of what life was really like in 1977. The red phone boxes the killer uses, the thoroughly ugly headboards and brown pyjama sets worn by the sub postmasters when they are rudely awoken in the middle of the night by Neilson robbing their business. The film also shows how terrifying it must have been to be woken up by a man in a blood hood brandishing a sown off shotgun in your face.\u00a0\n\nThe BFI have done a great job with the Blu ray for the film as it looks and sounds amazing. There are also exhaustive liner notes from director Ian Merrick as to the curious history of the film, it's unwarranted suppression and it's re-emergence on Blu ray. There are also a wealth of extras such as short films and raw footage shot when locations were being sought for the film.\n\nThe Black Panther can now be seen for what it always was- an outstanding true crime film that was ahead of it's time.", 5.0]], "neg": [["well, actually this movie is from 1977!...Rotten tomatoes, you fail!

The first time I watched this movie I didn't quite understand it until I watched it for the second time. This movie goes into depth about how the pain of erasing/forcing yourself to forget someone you love so deeply and genuinely is worse than remembering and cherishing. This movie moved me so deeply and had a very valuable message to it that I hold wholeheartedly and had me in tears by the end. \nThis beautiful, genius film directed by Michel Gondry follows two past lovers who deeply loved each other but had a messy breakup. Following their split, Clementine dealing with the strong emotions of the breakup, sought out the company, Lacuna. A company that specializes in the procedure of erasing one's memories of a person. Joel finds this out after his friends tell him. This results in Joel too, getting the procedure done. In the moment of getting Clementine erased from his memory, he finds himself wanting to \u201ccall it off\u201d to keep these memories that are slowly slipping away. Filled with regret he realizes he still loves her. \nThe plot of this movie is similar to some messy relationships that don't end up working out and people who bad mouth their ex-lovers not wanting to admit that deep down, they still have so much love for them. This film might help us realize how we often take these memories with people we love for granted and how in the moment, we don't truly appreciate them until we don't have it anymore. How loving someone and getting to know them for their true self is a privilege people don't often come around. Throughout the movie, I was shown this with Joel's memories. While being erased, replaying those vulnerable moments and memories of a person who he once loved and wanted to marry; soon to be gone. How soon Clementine, was going to be just another stranger to him after all of it. \nThroughout this film, it's shown that love is strong despite differences, whether in personalities or looks. Joel is introverted, shy, calm, and scared of vulnerability but is in love with Clementine because she is bold, happy, sensitive, impulsive, and possibly even has undiagnosed bipolar personality disorder but Joel saw past that. It is shown that Clementine's free-spirited impulsive personality drove Joel to do things out of his comfort zone. This is shown in scenes when Clementine wanted to go to Montauk and they ended up at frozen lake the first night they met again after having their memories erased. Despite Joel being afraid and worried the ice was going to break, he was willing to lay on the ice lake with her. Joel loved her for her and went out of his comfort zone for love. Some people think that being polar opposites ruins the movie but I love it and think it's perfect and different from any other movie.  \n The small details in this movie made it amazing. With Clementine\u2019s hair changing all the time it gave the viewers a timeline of their relationship but had a deeper meaning. To some viewers, her colored hair could have just been something she liked to do, but I noticed each color meant something. When Clementine first met Joel, she had bright green hair with her roots growing out. Green means new beginnings. During their \u201choneymoon\u201d phase, she had red; meaning love. Nearing the end of their relationship, she dyed her hair orange; meaning arrogance.  Clementine was sometimes arrogant and her arrogance could've been a reason for their breakup so this tiny detail was incredibly smart when looked into deeper. Charlie Kaufman, the writer, was so genius for this as the meaning behind this detail was so tiny but also so deep. Her hair color was a reflection of how their relationship was going. \nOverall, the message behind this movie was powerful and the acting was beautiful. Despite Joel and Clementine having a rough breakup leading to them both getting their memories erased. In the end, they still found their way back to each other and were willing to work it out even if it meant it'd end in another heartbreak. They were willing to see past each other's mistakes and realize they were human and not perfect. Towards the end of the movie, after they had found out they both had their memories erased, Clementine and Joel were in the hallway of Joel's complex. There it was exchanged words, \u201cI'm not perfect.\u201d Clementine said \u201cI can't see anything that I don't like about you.\u201d- Joel \u201cBut you will.\u201d -Clementine \u201cOkay.\u201d said Joel. This small conversation exchanged between them was so heartbreaking but says so much. Love is powerful and when 2 humans are meant to be together and I believe they will always find their way back to each other and work for it. Loving somebody is never a mistake, it's a privilege, and it is beautiful.", 5.0], ["Very creative concept and filmmaking and a brand new look at Jim Carrey in a completely different type of role.

The first time I watched this movie I didn't quite understand it until I watched it for the second time. This movie goes into depth about how the pain of erasing/forcing yourself to forget someone you love so deeply and genuinely is worse than remembering and cherishing. This movie moved me so deeply and had a very valuable message to it that I hold wholeheartedly and had me in tears by the end. \nThis beautiful, genius film directed by Michel Gondry follows two past lovers who deeply loved each other but had a messy breakup. Following their split, Clementine dealing with the strong emotions of the breakup, sought out the company, Lacuna. A company that specializes in the procedure of erasing one's memories of a person. Joel finds this out after his friends tell him. This results in Joel too, getting the procedure done. In the moment of getting Clementine erased from his memory, he finds himself wanting to \u201ccall it off\u201d to keep these memories that are slowly slipping away. Filled with regret he realizes he still loves her. \nThe plot of this movie is similar to some messy relationships that don't end up working out and people who bad mouth their ex-lovers not wanting to admit that deep down, they still have so much love for them. This film might help us realize how we often take these memories with people we love for granted and how in the moment, we don't truly appreciate them until we don't have it anymore. How loving someone and getting to know them for their true self is a privilege people don't often come around. Throughout the movie, I was shown this with Joel's memories. While being erased, replaying those vulnerable moments and memories of a person who he once loved and wanted to marry; soon to be gone. How soon Clementine, was going to be just another stranger to him after all of it. \nThroughout this film, it's shown that love is strong despite differences, whether in personalities or looks. Joel is introverted, shy, calm, and scared of vulnerability but is in love with Clementine because she is bold, happy, sensitive, impulsive, and possibly even has undiagnosed bipolar personality disorder but Joel saw past that. It is shown that Clementine's free-spirited impulsive personality drove Joel to do things out of his comfort zone. This is shown in scenes when Clementine wanted to go to Montauk and they ended up at frozen lake the first night they met again after having their memories erased. Despite Joel being afraid and worried the ice was going to break, he was willing to lay on the ice lake with her. Joel loved her for her and went out of his comfort zone for love. Some people think that being polar opposites ruins the movie but I love it and think it's perfect and different from any other movie.  \n The small details in this movie made it amazing. With Clementine\u2019s hair changing all the time it gave the viewers a timeline of their relationship but had a deeper meaning. To some viewers, her colored hair could have just been something she liked to do, but I noticed each color meant something. When Clementine first met Joel, she had bright green hair with her roots growing out. Green means new beginnings. During their \u201choneymoon\u201d phase, she had red; meaning love. Nearing the end of their relationship, she dyed her hair orange; meaning arrogance.  Clementine was sometimes arrogant and her arrogance could've been a reason for their breakup so this tiny detail was incredibly smart when looked into deeper. Charlie Kaufman, the writer, was so genius for this as the meaning behind this detail was so tiny but also so deep. Her hair color was a reflection of how their relationship was going. \nOverall, the message behind this movie was powerful and the acting was beautiful. Despite Joel and Clementine having a rough breakup leading to them both getting their memories erased. In the end, they still found their way back to each other and were willing to work it out even if it meant it'd end in another heartbreak. They were willing to see past each other's mistakes and realize they were human and not perfect. Towards the end of the movie, after they had found out they both had their memories erased, Clementine and Joel were in the hallway of Joel's complex. There it was exchanged words, \u201cI'm not perfect.\u201d Clementine said \u201cI can't see anything that I don't like about you.\u201d- Joel \u201cBut you will.\u201d -Clementine \u201cOkay.\u201d said Joel. This small conversation exchanged between them was so heartbreaking but says so much. Love is powerful and when 2 humans are meant to be together and I believe they will always find their way back to each other and work for it. Loving somebody is never a mistake, it's a privilege, and it is beautiful.", 5.0], ["Very creative concept and filmmaking and a brand new look at Jim Carrey in a completely different type of role.

Every lyric, every emotion, every bit of longing and heartbreak Ariana poured into it feels even more profound after witnessing the film that inspired it. This isn\u2019t just a film; it\u2019s a visceral, emotional labyrinth of love, memory, and loss.\n\nThe storytelling is nothing short of genius. The way it manipulates time, the way it forces you to feel Joel\u2019s desperation, Clementine\u2019s chaos, their joy, their destruction\u2014it\u2019s suffocating, intoxicating, and utterly unforgettable.

Rahman finally won his Academy Award for music in this film, and many fans would argue that this isn't one of his better scores. That might be true, but ARR proves with this score that he has so much ability and versatility with his music that he is able to bring a highly authentic score within each new movie he does. The Latika theme alone is a great example of why he won the many awards that he did that year. Its a movie that is such a unique trip, that you need to watch it in order to understand why it has been celebrated for all these years.", 5.0], ["Slumdog Millionaire is one of those movies that really sticks with you. It follows Jamal, a kid from the slums of Mumbai. Watching him go through so much and still come out with hope makes it pretty powerful.\n\nThe movie does a great job showing the reality of life for kids in poverty but doesn\u2019t feel like it\u2019s trying to preach. Director Danny Boyle keeps things moving with a fast pace, and the mix of tension, humor, and drama keeps you hooked. The visuals are great too, showing all sides of Mumbai, from the city to the harshness of life in the slums.\n\nOverall, Slumdog Millionaire is a must-watch. It\u2019s raw, emotional, and, at the end of the day, it\u2019s a story about resilience and hope. Perfect for when you want a movie that hits hard but leaves you feeling uplifted.", 4.5], ["Real and raw. An insight into a culture and suffering that most of the planet would never get insight into.

Director Danny Boyle never waters down the gruesomeness of his story that, while not necessarily a true one, offers a unique and tough approach to the life of the Indian underworld from a great perspective of an unfairly treated character, using the premise as the storytelling engine, and delivering a great use of narrative flashbacks and current events, this drama might go onto over-the-top corners at times, but it's effectivity relays of the professionalism of Boyle's direction.", 5.0], ["Fantastic work from director Danny Boyle that makes it stand out amongst his best works, \"Slumdog Millionaire\" takes a generic story and manages to make it seem fresh, unique, and one of the most vibrantly dazzling and uplifting movies in the history of recent filmmaking.", 5.0], ["Hugely entertaining, packed with thrills, energy and funs.

Did he cheat? Or is he just that lucky? The film traces his early childhood to his preteen years to the present; Malik's best friends are covered too including his brother, Salim Salim has always been competitive and chooses a life of crime After their mother dies they are on their own living on the streets in Mumbai He's also been in love with Pinto as Latika who hasn't had such an easy life, she's been thrown out of her home picked up by bad men for years Danny Boyle amazingly has this film cover a part of India that many tend to overlook stricken with poverty, pollution, religious conflict The program is the most popular watched by citizens because it's the only hope they have to get away from the caste system It's also known that Boyle when he was filming on location much of the entertainment industry is tied to the mafia which explains why law enforcement is crooked since they're bought and paid off This explains much of the interrogation going on at the film's opening Malik explains while being interrogated what money does to people, you don't have to be a genius He goes from a slumdog to an underdog The film gets by with brilliant acting, dazzling imagery, incredible Indian players giving it authenticity, and a wonderful mood thanks to the music and cultural aspects Malik and Latika are easily the best parts of this whole thing because no matter how much money there is love is the only true prize that matters Think of it like a fairytale with a hint of social consciousness, with the imagination and hopefulness of children that sweeps you in taking you on this man's journey fighting against his country\u2019s history and societal expectations It manages to transcend race, gender, region, and class The subject matter is depressing but it shows even an individual from the most desolate part of the world can rise up against oppression with optimism An incredible piece of art by Boyle and everyone involved not being an Americanized version of India but also a worthy Bollywood picture admonishing it while embracing it too", 4.5], ["this movie changed my life, from the beautiful videography to the amazing soundtrack. and the actors were on point, the story was absolutely riveting and it was just legitimately one of the best movies ive ever seen. must watch", 5.0]], "neg": [["Not bad, I just found it boring.

The political themes hold up very well and even feel ahead of its time, with some nuanced depictions of moral gray areas as well, such as V\u2019s loyalty test for Natalie Portman\u2019s character (albeit with a rather twisted redemption following this revelation). The ending climax with the entire city taking up the mantle, but elevating it with a less violent, but still disruptive approach is the perfect way to end this captivating Orwellian tale, with V\u2019s train ride goodbye being the cherry on top. Hugo Weaving gives V so much screen presence and personality with just his voice acting and body language. You really feel the gravitas and history with this character and can easily see why he could become so influential in this revolution against tyranny. Natalie Portman is also terrific as his reluctant prot\u00e9g\u00e9 and the only one to respark the humanity from his core that remained buried under grief and vengeance for so long (albeit with a questionable abuse subplot with the fake prison). Even the bureaucratic detective gets a subtle and nuanced character arc as he grows more dissident the further he progresses with his investigation and learns more about the dark machinations behind the curtain of his seemingly civilized government. The action sequences are brief, but badass and serve as frosting for the cake of this political thriller narrative.

When your country is being run by a corrupt government, where is the line between right and wrong? \u201cV for Vendetta\u201d is a film surrounded the ideas of freedom and resistance against the government. The film is set in a future where the UK\u2019s government has been taken over, and the main character, V, feels a calling to bring freedom back to his country. I have seen many movies about fighting against the government, but never have I watched one quite like this. \n\nThe storyline for this film follows V's personal vendetta against the government. V is focused on freeing his country from the government, but he is also focused on bringing the people of his country to realize the importance of resisting a wrong government. This goes along well with his relationship with the girl he saved, Evey. Evey was initially skeptical of what V does, but as we get further into the video, we can see that V has helped her to be courageous enough to fight for what she believes in. We can see this when Evey gets imprisoned, saying she will not cooperate even after being told she would be executed if she didn\u2019t. A major thing for the storyline in this movie is the character developments shown. Evey went through a major development, but another person to look at is Finch. Finch is the investigator who is on a major hunt for V and Evey, but as the movie progresses, we can see that he begins to understand V\u2019s reasoning behind what he does. I do feel like some of the movie was a bit rushed, like V\u2019s backstory. V is incredibly dedicated to fighting his government, but the only reason we get for this is because he was experimented on. He supposedly did not remember his past after this, so I was confused on how he went from being experimented on in a detention center to being the government's #1 enemy. \n\n The cinematography for this film is done very well.  In the beginning of the movie, when the Old Bailey explodes, they used slow motion and a large contrast between the light of the explosion and the dark sky. They also give the explosion fireworks, which end up forming a V. This part alone gives a sense of justice. They consistently use shadows and lighting to create tense scenes. In the ending fight scene, it is very dark, with whichever character who is talking at the time\u2019s face being the only thing lit up. They also speed the music up as the argument progresses, and the action goes into slow motion when V starts to fight them. There are so many parts of the cinematography that bring each scene together. It gives viewers a sense of excitement and anticipation to see what will happen next. \n\nOverall, \u201cV for Vendetta\u201d is worth the watch. It is not just a good movie; it is also an inspiration to fight for what is right. Obviously, no one is saying that it is okay to kill people, but it is saying it is okay to not let yourself or the people around you get treated unfairly. The movie has some parts that could be better, but it is definitely worth watching.", 3.5], ["Spoiler warning Intro: V for Vendetta, the movie was released in 2005, and the novel was published in 1982.

A fun fact: V is inspired by Guy Fawkes, a historical figure involved in the Gunpowder Plot of 1605; he wears the same mask as him. The film starts with V rescuing Evey Hammond, a young woman who is caught up after the curfew that the government placed. Then, after V saves Evey, they develop a unique relationship. I didn't enjoy V\u2019s relationship with Evey, and I think they should have just stuck to one in the novel. While they trust each other and become close in the novel, they take a more romantic angle in the film, which I do not like. Evey then joins V to help him topple the government. \n\nCinematic Techniques: The film has striking visuals for a movie in 2005, mainly for V's mask and the repeated designs of the letter \"V. \" V's Guy Fawkes mask has since become an iconic symbol of protest in the real world as well as a rebellion in real-world movements. Another element I loved is how the lighting was used in the film during V\u2019s confrontations with government agents. It added to the tension and mystery of the film. I think the film's techniques were very well done for its time, and it kept me watching all the way through.\n\nActing: Hugo Weaving, who plays V, does a beautiful job despite never showing his face. One of my favorite scenes from this is when V saves Evey from government agents and then introduces himself. His voice and body language are enough to carry the character. Hugo Weaving did such a good job; he is the reason the mask has so much symbolism in the real world now. Even I know the mask now, and it is from a group of hackers that call themselves anonymous. They always use the same mask as V. The acting in the movie is so great now that I have a new appearance for Hugo Weaving, and then, just his role in The Matrix. \n\n        Conclusion: V for Vendetta is more than just a typical action film it also can be viewed as a political statement for freedom and justice.

When your country is being run by a corrupt government, where is the line between right and wrong? \u201cV for Vendetta\u201d is a film surrounded the ideas of freedom and resistance against the government. The film is set in a future where the UK\u2019s government has been taken over, and the main character, V, feels a calling to bring freedom back to his country. I have seen many movies about fighting against the government, but never have I watched one quite like this. \n\nThe storyline for this film follows V's personal vendetta against the government. V is focused on freeing his country from the government, but he is also focused on bringing the people of his country to realize the importance of resisting a wrong government. This goes along well with his relationship with the girl he saved, Evey. Evey was initially skeptical of what V does, but as we get further into the video, we can see that V has helped her to be courageous enough to fight for what she believes in. We can see this when Evey gets imprisoned, saying she will not cooperate even after being told she would be executed if she didn\u2019t. A major thing for the storyline in this movie is the character developments shown. Evey went through a major development, but another person to look at is Finch. Finch is the investigator who is on a major hunt for V and Evey, but as the movie progresses, we can see that he begins to understand V\u2019s reasoning behind what he does. I do feel like some of the movie was a bit rushed, like V\u2019s backstory. V is incredibly dedicated to fighting his government, but the only reason we get for this is because he was experimented on. He supposedly did not remember his past after this, so I was confused on how he went from being experimented on in a detention center to being the government's #1 enemy. \n\n The cinematography for this film is done very well.  In the beginning of the movie, when the Old Bailey explodes, they used slow motion and a large contrast between the light of the explosion and the dark sky. They also give the explosion fireworks, which end up forming a V. This part alone gives a sense of justice. They consistently use shadows and lighting to create tense scenes. In the ending fight scene, it is very dark, with whichever character who is talking at the time\u2019s face being the only thing lit up. They also speed the music up as the argument progresses, and the action goes into slow motion when V starts to fight them. There are so many parts of the cinematography that bring each scene together. It gives viewers a sense of excitement and anticipation to see what will happen next. \n\nOverall, \u201cV for Vendetta\u201d is worth the watch. It is not just a good movie; it is also an inspiration to fight for what is right. Obviously, no one is saying that it is okay to kill people, but it is saying it is okay to not let yourself or the people around you get treated unfairly.

The technique of combining animatronics and CGI makes the Dinos look real.

The movie starts as a basic Dino movie to a horror in 10 minutes. While yes I knew the kids and most of the main cast were going to survive I was praying that they make it out of the prehistoric hell. The genius mind of Steve Spielberg is able to bring the movie from a fantasy, to a honor, to a Fantasy, to a horror is just remarkable. It doesn\u2019t feel like a there is a messed up tone in the movie. The animatronics are so detailed making them look like there paleo accurate designs of the 1990s. The second act of grant trying to get the kids back to the main lobby and the second archaeologist trying to bring the power back on makes you invested in every side story in the movie.

The older kid some how knowing how to bring the power back on while Samual A Jackson couldn\u2019t is kinda an ass pull. While I think the theme they where trying to achieve is (especially in the 90s when computers started to become more of a main piece of the household) is that the young generation knows how to better operate newer devices and technology than the older one. Rexy (the main tyrannosaur Rex in the movie) just comes out of no where to kill the Raptors is just another ass pull. Speaking of the Raptors, I see them as the main threat of the movie.

Each time I watch this movie, it\u2019s look like eating my all favourites flavours, in the same time, sweet or salt. Pure pleasure. \n\n    The special-effect are realistic, and good. Acting is very well, all the characters has their own personality, with fault and qualities. \n\n    The crew makes two movies after this film. Honestly, I think the one is better.

Enough to be called a Young Adult Sci-Fi Classic. It's so obvious this wouldn't have made it to the big screen without the success of The Hunger Games and to an extent that's the biggest problem here. It's just a slightly less inferior version of the first Hunger Games in a sense. Young Adult characters trapped in dystopian Sci-Fi future puzzle. This doesn't really have the same type of commentary as that despite sharing some of the same symbols. The music isn't bad but it can be generic and doesn't leave the biggest impression until the final few scenes I'd say. The acting isn't bad either but it varies to say the least. Some characters are more interesting or better acted than others. Thomas is alright I guess. He doesn't have that memorable a backstory, lacks charisma in the performance despite being a leader and a clear traditional character arc for these types of flicks. And I really struggle to remember much about him. No one really has that much chemistry with each other. Ben and Gally aren't bad. Teresa is alright but I struggle to really see a point for her here since there isn't any romanctic subplot. The direction really isn't anything special either. However, everything else is solid enough. The special effects are good overall but the creature design is very stock and looks like every Sci-Fi CGI alien from the 2010's. It looks so simliar to After Earth and a bunch of others. The maze is a cool idea and this does a good job keeping it focused on the most interesting aspect. What's in the maze and finding a way out. It's this main plot point that drives all the character interactions and follows a logical flow. The drama moments between the other kids in between isn't bad but defintely not as interesting as the maze. But it does work enough, I wanted to learn more, and the ending was good I feel with some good twists and turns. I'm open to seeing more of this world.

Frozen\u2019s hard working animators yield Disney\u2019s most impressive computer animation to date. I have always preferred hand drawn animation for its timeless quality and comforting personality. Now I can say that because of Frozen, computer animation can look great as well and hold up over time. Elsa\u2019s fractal patterned ice spells are just the animators flexing their potential capabilities and they sure are gorgeous. Chris Beck and Jennifer Lee\u2019s direction is beautiful and quick. They tell their story with swift shots and smooth motion. They bring out genuine emotions from their actors. Frozen is honestly the best feature film Disney has done in over a decade.\n\nInspired by Hans Christian Andersen\u2019s fairy tale \u201cThe Snow Queen,\u201d Disney adapts a classic into a beloved children\u2019s movie for families to enjoy forever. Jennifer Lee\u2019s writing is grounded in her themes of sisterhood, friendship, trust, and confidence. I love how she never gives Elsa a boyfriend or love interest in this one as it\u2019s more about Elsa\u2019s fears and growth from an insecure girl into a free independent woman with agency and choice who loves her sister.\n\nI love the icy aesthetic Frozen dons with pride. All the blues and whites everywhere in Lisa Keene and Michael Giaimo\u2019s art direction is striking like David Womersley\u2019s production design inspired by Swedish mythology and culture. Jeff Draheim\u2019s editing is quickly paced with fast and frosty jump cuts from action sequences to conversational drama for Frozen\u2019s brisk 102. Christophe Beck\u2019s score is breathtaking and rousing with beautiful swells of symphonic bliss. I love his music for Frozen. He sets a moody atmosphere that\u2019s both serious and playful as necessary.\n\nFrozen is primarily famous for the instantly iconic Disney tune \u201cLet It Go,\u201d which is impressively sung by the unbelievably talented Idina Menzel. Her voice is awe inspiring in her range and power, while pretty and gentle enough to mesmerize you. Idina Menzel\u2019s vocal performance as Queen Elsa is remarkable as she gives Elsa an endearing personality, genuine vulnerability, and sincere sensitivity with a vocal strength. Her insecurity and confidence mark a complex role as a voice actress from Idina that\u2019s very endearing. Elsa is one of my favorite Disney princesses now because of Idina Menzel\u2019s wonderful voice acting. Menzel was born to voice Elsa in Frozen!\n\nKristen Bell is awesome and lively as the likable Princess Anna in Frozen. She gets a cute song called \u201cDo You Want to Build a Snowman?\u201d that\u2019s very pretty and expressive. Bell has never been more endearing than she is as Anna in Frozen. Jonathan Groff is excellent as the fun simpleton Kristoff with his adorable reindeer Sven.\n\nJosh Gad delivers an unforgettable performance as Elsa and Anna\u2019s snowman friend Olaf. His observational humor is funny to hilarious. Olaf has become inseparable from pop culture, so I understand how people find him over the top or obnoxious, but Gad is incredible in Frozen. His first song is even fun. Santino Fontana is great as the multi-faceted Hans. Alan Tudyk is funny as the reprehensible Duke. Maurice LaMarche sounds cool as the king. Livvy Stubenrauch is really emotional as the playful and distraught young Anna. Lastly, Eva Bella is earnest and devastating as a frightened young Elsa.\n\nHonestly, I only don\u2019t like the troll song in Frozen. The trolls feel too childish and immature for the more serious Frozen.

Elsa\u2019s fractal patterned ice spells are just the animators flexing their potential capabilities and they sure are gorgeous. Chris Beck and Jennifer Lee\u2019s direction is beautiful and quick.

Jonathan Groff is excellent as the fun simpleton Kristoff with his adorable reindeer Sven.\n\nJosh Gad delivers an unforgettable performance as Elsa and Anna\u2019s snowman friend Olaf. His observational humor is funny to hilarious. Olaf has become inseparable from pop culture, so I understand how people find him over the top or obnoxious, but Gad is incredible in Frozen.

The movie details a hero family in an already-established world of heroes and villains as they try to be normal after a world outlawed supers from using their powers in public. This premise forces them to think outside the box with what heroes can be and how they feel about their own identities. The entire movie builds up to the villain behind it all and they absolutely deliver in the best ways possible.
